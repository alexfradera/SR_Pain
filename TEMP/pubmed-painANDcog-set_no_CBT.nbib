TI  - ICU delirium - a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in the intensive care unit.
PG  - 160-167
LID - 10.5603/AIT.a2018.0011 [doi]
AB  - ICU delirium is a common medical problem occurring in patients admitted to the 
      intensive care units (ICUs). Studies have shown that ICU delirium is associated with 
      increased mortality, prolonged hospitalization, prolonged mechanical ventilation, 
      costs and the occurrence of cognitive disoders after discharge from ICU. The tools 
      available for ICU delirium screening and diagnosis are validated tests available for 
      all members if the medical team (physicians, nurses, physiotherapists). Their use 
      for routine patient assessment is recommended by international medical and 
      scientific societies. They have been implemented as Pain, Agitation, Delirium (PAD) 
      Guidelines by the Society of Critical Care Medicine. Apart from monitoring, a 
      strategy of prevention and treatment is recommended, based on non-pharmacological 
      approach (restoration of senses, early mobilization, physiotherapy, improvement in 
      sleep hygiene and family involvement) as well as pharmacological treatment (typical 
      and atypical antipsychotics and dexmedetomidine). In this article, we present the 
      risk factors of ICU delirium, available tools for monitoring, as well as options for 
      prevention and treatment of delirium that can be used to improve care over 
      critically ill patients.

TI  - Genome-wide association analyses identify 44 risk variants and refine the genetic 
      architecture of major depression.
PG  - 668-681
LID - 10.1038/s41588-018-0090-3 [doi]
AB  - Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common illness accompanied by considerable 
      morbidity, mortality, costs, and heightened risk of suicide. We conducted a 
      genome-wide association meta-analysis based in 135,458 cases and 344,901 controls 
      and identified 44 independent and significant loci. The genetic findings were 
      associated with clinical features of major depression and implicated brain regions 
      exhibiting anatomical differences in cases. Targets of antidepressant medications 
      and genes involved in gene splicing were enriched for smaller association signal. We 
      found important relationships of genetic risk for major depression with educational 
      attainment, body mass, and schizophrenia: lower educational attainment and higher 
      body mass were putatively causal, whereas major depression and schizophrenia 
      reflected a partly shared biological etiology. All humans carry lesser or greater 
      numbers of genetic risk factors for major depression. These findings help refine the 
      basis of major depression and imply that a continuous measure of risk underlies the 
      clinical phenotype.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD) and Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are the most represented 
      phytocannabinoids in Cannabis sativa plants. However, CBD may present with a 
      different activity compared with the psychotomimetic THC. Most typically, CBD is 
      reported to be used in some medical conditions, including chronic pain. Conversely, 
      the main aim of this systematic review is to assess and summarise the available body 
      of evidence relating to both efficacy and safety of CBD as a treatment for 
      psychiatric disorders, alone and/or in combination with other treatments. Eligible 
      studies included randomized controlled trials (RCT) assessing the effect of CBD in a 
      range of psychopathological conditions, such as substance use; psychosis, anxiety, 
      mood disturbances, and other psychiatric (e.g., cognitive impairment; sleep; 
      personality; eating; obsessive-compulsive; post-traumatic stress/PTSD; dissociative; 
      and somatic) disorders. For data gathering purposes, the PRISMA guidelines were 
      followed. The initial search strategy identified some n = 1301 papers; n = 190 
      studies were included after the abstract's screening and n = 27 articles met the 
      inclusion criteria. There is currently limited evidence regarding the safety and 
      efficacy of CBD for the treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, available 
      trials reported potential therapeutic effects for specific psychopathological 
      conditions, such as substance use disorders, chronic psychosis, and anxiety. Further 
      large-scale RCTs are required to better evaluate the efficacy of CBD in both acute 
      and chronic illnesses, special categories, as well as to exclude any possible abuse 
      liability.

TI  - Chronic stress, cortisol dysfunction, and pain: a psychoneuroendocrine rationale for 
      stress management in pain rehabilitation.
PG  - 1816-25
LID - 10.2522/ptj.20130597 [doi]
AB  - Pain is a primary symptom driving patients to seek physical therapy, and its 
      attenuation commonly defines a successful outcome. A large body of evidence is 
      dedicated to elucidating the relationship between chronic stress and pain; however, 
      stress is rarely addressed in pain rehabilitation. A physiologic stress response may 
      be evoked by fear or perceived threat to safety, status, or well-being and elicits 
      the secretion of sympathetic catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinepherine) and 
      neuroendocrine hormones (cortisol) to promote survival and motivate success. 
      Cortisol is a potent anti-inflammatory that functions to mobilize glucose reserves 
      for energy and modulate inflammation. Cortisol also may facilitate the consolidation 
      of fear-based memories for future survival and avoidance of danger. Although 
      short-term stress may be adaptive, maladaptive responses (eg, magnification, 
      rumination, helplessness) to pain or non-pain-related stressors may intensify 
      cortisol secretion and condition a sensitized physiologic stress response that is 
      readily recruited. Ultimately, a prolonged or exaggerated stress response may 
      perpetuate cortisol dysfunction, widespread inflammation, and pain. Stress may be 
      unavoidable in life, and challenges are inherent to success; however, humans have 
      the capability to modify what they perceive as stressful and how they respond to it. 
      Exaggerated psychological responses (eg, catastrophizing) following maladaptive 
      cognitive appraisals of potential stressors as threatening may exacerbate cortisol 
      secretion and facilitate the consolidation of fear-based memories of pain or 
      non-pain-related stressors; however, coping, cognitive reappraisal, or confrontation 
      of stressors may minimize cortisol secretion and prevent chronic, recurrent pain. 
      Given the parallel mechanisms underlying the physiologic effects of a maladaptive 
      response to pain and non-pain-related stressors, physical therapists should consider 
      screening for non-pain-related stress to facilitate treatment, prevent chronic 
      disability, and improve quality of life.

AB  - Clinical evaluation of neurologic disorders in the elderly requires seeking a 
      thorough history and performing an age-appropriate neurologic examination with 
      special attention to changes that occur with normal aging. The history should be 
      obtained from the patient as well as collateral sources close to the patient to 
      ensure accuracy and should include contextual elements such as medical history, 
      social, economic, and psychological background, as well as an assessment of current 
      functional state beyond activities of daily living. The safety of the patient, 
      including the presence of physical, psychological, and financial threats, should be 
      addressed during the interview. The neurological examination in older adults may 
      need to be modified to circumvent disabilities such as hearing and visual 
      impairment. Some elements of the neurological examination are expected to be 
      affected by the process of aging, including pupillary reactivity, presbyopia, 
      difficulty with ocular pursuit and up-gaze, reduced or absent distal reflexes, 
      slower motor speed, and reduced ability to tandem walk, among others. In addition to 
      a screening neurological assessment, evaluation of older adults with a particular 
      complaint may require additional interview queries and examination manoeuvres. 
      Common symptoms in the elderly include cognitive difficulties, balance and gait 
      disorders, tremors, and neuropathy. A specialized approach to patients with 
      cognitive difficulties must include assessment of each cognitive domain, including 
      attention, executive function, learning and memory, perceptual-motor function, and 
      social cognition. Balance and gait are essential parts of the neurological 
      examination, and in patients with a history of falls or mobility issues, should 
      become a central part of the evaluation. In patient with tremors, careful 
      observation of the tremor quality (amplitude, frequency, and 
      alleviating/exacerbating factors such as rest, movement, and posture) can aid 
      diagnosis. Evaluation of neuropathy includes determining modality (numbness, 
      tingling, pain, and weakness) and the distribution of symptoms in order to localize 
      the site of nerve injury, which can be supplemented with nerve conduction 
      studies/electromyography, to guide further diagnostic workup and treatment. A 
      combination of detailed history and examination often will suggest a likely 
      underlying neurodegenerative disorder and guide further diagnostic workup to 
      establish a specific diagnosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Modifiable vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors have been 
      associated with dementia risk in observational studies. In the Finnish Geriatric 
      Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER), a 
      proof-of-concept randomised controlled trial, we aimed to assess a multidomain 
      approach to prevent cognitive decline in at-risk elderly people from the general 
      population. METHODS: In a double-blind randomised controlled trial we enrolled 
      individuals aged 60-77 years recruited from previous national surveys. Inclusion 
      criteria were CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) Dementia Risk 
      Score of at least 6 points and cognition at mean level or slightly lower than 
      expected for age. We randomly assigned participants in a 1:1 ratio to a 2 year 
      multidomain intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular risk 
      monitoring), or a control group (general health advice). Computer-generated 
      allocation was done in blocks of four (two individuals randomly allocated to each 
      group) at each site. Group allocation was not actively disclosed to participants and 
      outcome assessors were masked to group allocation. The primary outcome was change in 
      cognition as measured through comprehensive neuropsychological test battery (NTB) Z 
      score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat (all participants with at least 
      one post-baseline observation). This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, 
      number NCT01041989. FINDINGS: Between Sept 7, 2009, and Nov 24, 2011, we screened 
      2654 individuals and randomly assigned 1260 to the intervention group (n=631) or 
      control group (n=629). 591 (94%) participants in the intervention group and 599 
      (95%) in the control group had at least one post-baseline assessment and were 
      included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis. Estimated mean change in NTB 
      total Z score at 2 years was 0·20 (SE 0·02, SD 0·51) in the intervention group and 
      0·16 (0·01, 0·51) in the control group. Between-group difference in the change of 
      NTB total score per year was 0·022 (95% CI 0·002-0·042, p=0·030). 153 (12%) 
      individuals dropped out overall. Adverse events occurred in 46 (7%) participants in 
      the intervention group compared with six (1%) participants in the control group; the 
      most common adverse event was musculoskeletal pain (32 [5%] individuals for 
      intervention vs no individuals for control). INTERPRETATION: Findings from this 
      large, long-term, randomised controlled trial suggest that a multidomain 
      intervention could improve or maintain cognitive functioning in at-risk elderly 
      people from the general population. FUNDING: Academy of Finland, La Carita

TI  - Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder.
PG  - 431-444
LID - 10.1038/s41588-019-0344-8 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of 
      neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic 
      variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual 
      variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase 
      from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association 
      meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified 
      five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes 
      with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major 
      depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared 
      with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic 
      architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity 
      across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly 
      relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed 
      at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.

TI  - [Effectiveness of education based on neuroscience in the treatment of 
      musculoskeletal chronic pain].
PG  - 1-12
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic pain is one of the most frequent health, economic and social 
      problems. Given this, numerous approaches have been described, one of which is pain 
      neuroscience education. AIM: To examine the effectiveness of pain neuroscience 
      education in the treatment of musculoskeletal disorders with chronic pain and to 
      explore the impact of specific aspects of the technique on its effectiveness. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: Relevant studies published between 2000 and 2015 were 
      identified by searching PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Studies identified by 
      electronic searches were screened against a set of pre-defined inclusion criteria. 
      PEDro and SIGN scales were used to evaluate the methodological quality of the 
      included studies. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this systematic review. The 
      main outcomes that were measured were pain, disability, neurophysiology pain test, 
      attitudes and beliefs, fear-avoidance beliefs, self-care, kinesiophobia, quality of 
      life and algometry. The results suggest that pain neuroscience education is 
      effective in the short term and medium/long term for pain relief, either alone or 
      combined with multimodal treatment. It was also effective in normalizing cognitions 
      about pain, fear-avoidance beliefs, and self-care. CONCLUSION: Despite some evidence 
      for a positive effect in the short and medium/long term, the heterogeneity in the 
      technical aspects used does not allow the obtaining of conclusive results.

AB  - The stress-diathesis model posits that suicide is the result of an interaction 
      between state-dependent (environmental) stressors and a trait-like diathesis or 
      susceptibility to suicidal behaviour, independent of psychiatric disorders. Findings 
      from post-mortem studies of the brain and from genomic and in-vivo neuroimaging 
      studies indicate a biological basis for this diathesis, indicating the importance of 
      neurobiological screening and interventions, in addition to cognitive and mood 
      interventions, in the prevention of suicide. Early-life adversity and epigenetic 
      mechanisms might explain some of the link between suicide risk and brain circuitry 
      and neurochemistry abnormalities. Results from a range of studies using diverse 
      designs and post-mortem and in-vivo techniques show impairments of the serotonin 
      neurotransmitter system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis stress-response 
      system in the diathesis for suicidal behaviour. These impairments manifest as 
      impaired cognitive control of mood, pessimism, reactive aggressive traits, impaired 
      problem solving, over-reactivity to negative social signs, excessive emotional pain, 
      and suicidal ideation, leading to suicidal behaviour. Biomarkers related to the 
      diathesis might help to inform risk-assessment procedures and treatment choice in 
      the prevention of suicide.

TI  - Yoga for stroke rehabilitation.
PG  - CD011483

LID - CD011483
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stroke is a major health issue and cause of long-term disability and has 
      a major emotional and socioeconomic impact. There is a need to explore options for 
      long-term sustainable interventions that support stroke survivors to engage in 
      meaningful activities to address life challenges after stroke. Rehabilitation 
      focuses on recovery of function and cognition to the maximum level achievable, and 
      may include a wide range of complementary strategies including yoga.Yoga is a 
      mind-body practice that originated in India, and which has become increasingly 
      widespread in the Western world. Recent evidence highlights the positive effects of 
      yoga for people with a range of physical and psychological health conditions. A 
      recent non-Cochrane systematic review concluded that yoga can be used as 
      self-administered practice in stroke rehabilitation. OBJECTIVES: To assess the 
      effectiveness of yoga, as a stroke rehabilitation intervention, on recovery of 
      function and quality of life (QoL). SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Stroke 
      Group Trials Register (last searched July 2017), Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (last searched July 2017), MEDLINE (to July 2017), 
      Embase (to July 2017), CINAHL (to July 2017), AMED (to July 2017), PsycINFO (to July 
      2017), LILACS (to July 2017), SciELO (to July 2017), IndMED (to July 2017), OTseeker 
      (to July 2017) and PEDro (to July 2017). We also searched four trials registers, and 
      one conference abstracts database. We screened reference lists of relevant 
      publications and contacted authors for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA: 
      We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared yoga with a 
      waiting-list control or no intervention control in stroke survivors. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data from the included 
      studies. We performed all analyses using Review Manager (RevMan). One review author 
      entered the data into RevMan; another checked the entries. We discussed 
      disagreements with a third review author until consensus was reached. We used the 
      Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool. Where we considered studies to be sufficiently 
      similar, we conducted a meta-analysis by pooling the appropriate data. For outcomes 
      for which it was inappropriate or impossible to pool quantitatively, we conducted a 
      descriptive analysis and provided a narrative summary. MAIN RESULTS: We included two 
      RCTs involving 72 participants. Sixty-nine participants were included in one 
      meta-analysis (balance). Both trials assessed QoL, along with secondary outcomes 
      measures relating to movement and psychological outcomes; one also measured 
      disability.In one study the Stroke Impact Scale was used to measure QoL across six 
      domains, at baseline and post-intervention. The effect of yoga on five domains 
      (physical, emotion, communication, social participation, stroke recovery) was not 
      significant; however, the effect of yoga on the memory domain was significant (mean 
      difference (MD) 15.30, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29 to 29.31, P = 0.03), the 
      evidence for this finding was very low grade. In the second study, QoL was assessed 
      using the Stroke-Specifc QoL Scale; no significant effect was found.Secondary 
      outcomes included movement, strength and endurance, and psychological variables, 
      pain, and disability.Balance was measured in both studies using the Berg Balance 
      Scale; the effect of intervention was not significant (MD 2.38, 95% CI -1.41 to 
      6.17, P = 0.22). Sensititivy analysis did not alter the direction of effect. One 
      study measured balance self-efficacy, using the Activities-specific Balance 
      Confidence Scale (MD 10.60, 95% CI -7.08,= to 28.28, P = 0.24); the effect of 
      intervention was not significant; the evidence for this finding was very low 
      grade.One study measured gait using the Comfortable Speed Gait Test (MD 1.32, 95% CI 
      -1.35 to 3.99, P = 0.33), and motor function using the Motor Assessment Scale (MD 
      -4.00, 95% CI -12.42 to 4.42, P = 0.35); no significant effect was found based on 
      very low-grade evidence.One study measured disability using the modified Rankin 
      Scale (mRS) but reported only whether participants were independent or dependent. No 
      significant effect was found: (odds ratio (OR) 2.08, 95% CI 0.50 to 8.60, P = 0.31); 
      the evidence for this finding was very low grade.Anxiety and depression were 
      measured in one study. Three measures were used: the Geriatric Depression 
      Scale-Short Form (GCDS15), and two forms of State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI, 
      Form Y) to measure state anxiety (i.e. anxiety experienced in response to stressful 
      situations) and trait anxiety (i.e. anxiety associated with chronic psychological 
      disorders). No significant effect was found for depression (GDS15, MD -2.10, 95% CI 
      -4.70 to 0.50, P = 0.11) or for trait anxiety (STAI-Y2, MD -6.70, 95% CI -15.35 to 
      1.95, P = 0.13), based on very low-grade evidence. However, a significant effect was 
      found for state anxiety: STAI-Y1 (MD -8.40, 95% CI -16.74 to -0.06, P = 0.05); the 
      evidence for this finding was very low grade.No adverse events were reported.Quality 
      of the evidenceWe assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Overall, the 
      quality of the evidence was very low, due to the small number of trials included in 
      the review both of which were judged to be at high risk of bias, particularly in 
      relation to incompleteness of data and selective reporting, and especially regarding 
      the representative nature of the sample in one study. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Yoga has 
      the potential for being included as part of patient-centred stroke rehabilitation. 
      However, this review has identified insufficient information to confirm or refute 
      the effectiveness or safety of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment. Further 
      large-scale methodologically robust trials are required to establish the 
      effectiveness of yoga as a stroke rehabilitation treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Synthetic cannabinoids (SC) are a heterogeneous group of compounds 
      developed to probe the endogenous cannabinoid system or as potential therapeutics. 
      Clandestine laboratories subsequently utilized published data to develop SC 
      variations marketed as abusable designer drugs. In the early 2000s, SC became 
      popular as "legal highs" under brand names such as Spice and K2, in part due to 
      their ability to escape detection by standard cannabinoid screening tests. The 
      majority of SC detected in herbal products have greater binding affinity to the 
      cannabinoid CB1 receptor than does Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary 
      psychoactive compound in the cannabis plant, and greater affinity at the CB1 than 
      the CB2 receptor. In vitro and animal in vivo studies show SC pharmacological 
      effects 2-100 times more potent than THC, including analgesic, anti-seizure, 
      weight-loss, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer growth effects. SC produce 
      physiological and psychoactive effects similar to THC, but with greater intensity, 
      resulting in medical and psychiatric emergencies. Human adverse effects include 
      nausea and vomiting, shortness of breath or depressed breathing, hypertension, 
      tachycardia, chest pain, muscle twitches, acute renal failure, anxiety, agitation, 
      psychosis, suicidal ideation, and cognitive impairment. Long-term or residual 
      effects are unknown. Due to these public health consequences, many SC are classified 
      as controlled substances. However, frequent structural modification by clandestine 
      laboratories results in a stream of novel SC that may not be legally controlled or 
      detectable by routine laboratory tests. METHODS: We present here a comprehensive 
      review, based on a systematic electronic literature search, of SC epidemiology and 
      pharmacology and their clinical implications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Mindfulness based interventions (MBI) have recently gained much interest 
      in western medicine. MBSR paradigm is based on teaching participants to pay complete 
      attention to the present experience and act nonjudgmentally towards stressful 
      events. During this mental practice the meditator focuses his or her attention on 
      the sensations of the body. While the distractions (mental images, thoughts, 
      emotional or somatic states) arise the participant is taught to acknowledge 
      discursive thoughts and cultivate the state of awareness without immediate reaction. 
      The effectiveness of these programs is well documented in the field of emotional 
      response regulation in depression (relapse prevention), anxiety disorders, 
      obsessive-compulsive disorder or eating disorders. Furthermore, converging lines of 
      evidence support the hypothesis that mindfulness practice improves cognition, 
      especially the ability to sustain attention and think in a more flexible manner. 
      Nevertheless, formal rehabilitation programs targeting cognitive disturbances 
      resulting from psychiatric (depression, disorder bipolar, schizophrenia) or 
      neurologic conditions (brain injury, dementia) seldom rely on MBI principles. This 
      review of literature aims at discussing possible links between MBI and clinical 
      neuropsychology. METHODS: We conducted a review of literature using electronic 
      databases up to December 2016, screening studies with variants of the keywords 
      ("Mindfulness", "MBI", "MBSR", "Meditation") OR/AND ("Cognition", "Attention", 
      "Executive function", "Memory", "Learning") RESULTS: In the first part, we describe 
      key concepts of the neuropsychology of attention in the light of Posner's model of 
      attention control. We also underline the potential scope of different therapeutic 
      contexts where disturbances of attention may be clinically relevant. Second, we 
      review the efficacy of MBI in the field of cognition (thinking disturbances, 
      attention biases, memory and executive processes impairment or low metacognitive 
      abilities), mood (emotional dysregulation, anxiety, depression, mood shifts) and 
      somatic preoccupations (stress induced immune dysregulation, chronic pain, body 
      representation, eating disorders, sleep quality, fatigue). In psychiatry, these 
      three components closely coexist and interact which explains the complexity of 
      patient assessment and care. Numerous studies show that meditation inspired 
      interventions offer a promising solution in the prevention and rehabilitation of 
      cognitive impairment. In the last part, we discuss the benefits and risks of 
      integrating meditation practice into broader programs of cognitive remediation and 
      therapeutic education in patients suffering from cognitive disorders. We propose a 
      number of possible guidelines for developing mindfulness inspired cognitive 
      remediation tools. Along with Jon Kabatt Zinn (Kabatt-Zinn & Maskens, 2012), we 
      suggest that the construction of neuropsychological tools relies on seven 
      attitudinal foundations of mindfulness practice. CONCLUSIONS: This paper highlights 
      the importance of referring to holistic approaches such as MBI when dealing with 
      patients with neuropsychological impairment, especially in the field of psychiatry. 
      We advocate introducing mindfulness principles in order to help patients stabilize 
      their attention and improve cognitive flexibility. We believe this transition in 
      neuropsychological care may offer an interesting paradigm shift promoting a more 
      efficient approach towards cognition and its links to emotion, body, and 
      environment.

TI  - Are Pain Beliefs, Cognitions, and Behaviors Influenced by Race, Ethnicity, and 
      Culture in Patients with Chronic Musculoskeletal Pain: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 541-558
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain has been considered as a biopsychosocial condition in which 
      cognitive and emotional factors as well as biological factors significantly affect 
      perception of pain. Race, ethnicity and culture have a crucial impact on illness 
      beliefs, health care preferences, help-seeking behaviors, and acceptance of medical 
      interventions. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to systematically review 
      the current evidence regarding the racial, ethnic and cultural alterations and 
      differences in pain beliefs, cognitions, and behaviors in patients with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain (MSKP). STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. METHODS: This 
      systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA). PubMed 
      and Web of Science were searched. A first screening was conducted based on title and 
      abstract of the articles. In the second screening, full-texts of the remaining 
      articles were evaluated for the fulfilment of the inclusion criteria. The risk of 
      bias was assessed with the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: A total of 11 
      articles were included. The methodological quality of the included studies ranged 
      from low to moderate. There is moderate evidence that African-Americans use more 
      praying, hoping, and emotion-focused coping strategies than Caucasians. There is 
      also preliminary evidence regarding the differences in some coping strategies such 
      as distraction, catastrophizing, and problem-focused solving between 
      African-Americans and Caucasians. Preliminary evidence exists regarding the 
      differences in pain coping strategies between the US and Portugal; the US and 
      Singapore; and among 4 French-speaking countries. It is found that Spanish patients 
      with fibromyalgia (FM) have more negative illness perceptions than Dutch patients. 
      There is preliminary evidence that Caucasians have higher self-efficacy than 
      African-Americans. There is also preliminary evidence that New Zealanders have more 
      internal health expectancies than patients from the US. Preliminary evidence is 
      demonstrated that Caucasians with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have more positive 
      control beliefs than African-Americans. Lastly, there is preliminary evidence that 
      patients from the US believe that they are more disabled, while Singaporeans 
      interpret the pain more by a traditional biomedical perspective. LIMITATIONS: Only 
      11 articles were included. The small number of articles, wide range of assessment 
      methods, and substantial risk of bias in the included studies led the investigator 
      to draw conclusions cautiously. CONCLUSION: Preliminary to moderate evidence shows 
      the differences in coping strategies, illness perceptions, self-efficacy, fear 
      avoidance beliefs, locus of control, and pain attitudes in different populations. 
      Further prospective and longitudinal studies using standard definitions for race, 
      ethnicity or culture and valid questionnaires for each population are warranted to 
      explore the racial, ethnic and cultural discrepancies in pain beliefs, cognitions, 
      and behaviours. KEY WORDS: Chronic pain, musculoskeletal pain, pain beliefs, pain 
      cognitions, pain behaviors, race, ethnicity, culture.

TI  - Frailty for Perioperative Clinicians: A Narrative Review.
PG  - 1450-1460
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004602 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a multidimensional syndrome characterized by decreased reserve and 
      diminished resistance to stressors. People with frailty are vulnerable to stressors, 
      and exposure to the stress of surgery is associated with increased risk of adverse 
      outcomes and higher levels of resource use. As Western populations age rapidly, 
      older people with frailty are presenting for surgery with increasing frequency. This 
      means that anesthesiologists and other perioperative clinicians need to be familiar 
      with frailty, its assessment, manifestations, and strategies for optimization. We 
      present a narrative review of frailty aimed at perioperative clinicians. The review 
      will familiarize readers with the concept of frailty, will discuss common and 
      feasible approaches to frailty assessment before surgery, and will describe the 
      relative and absolute associations of frailty with commonly measured adverse 
      outcomes, including morbidity and mortality, as well as patient-centered and 
      reported outcomes related to function, disability, and quality of life. A proposed 
      approach to optimization before surgery is presented, which includes frailty 
      assessment followed by recommendations for identification of underlying physical 
      disability, malnutrition, cognitive dysfunction, and mental health diagnoses. 
      Overall, 30%-50% of older patients presenting for major surgery will be living with 
      frailty, which results in a more than 2-fold increase in risk of morbidity, 
      mortality, and development of new patient-reported disability. The Clinical Frailty 
      Scale appears to be the most feasible frailty instrument for use before surgery; 
      however, evidence suggests that predictive accuracy does not differ significantly 
      between frailty instruments such as the Fried Phenotype, Edmonton Frail Scale, and 
      Frailty Index. Identification of physical dysfunction may allow for optimization via 
      exercise prehabilitation, while nutritional supplementation could be considered with 
      a positive screen for malnutrition. The Hospital Elder Life Program shows promise 
      for delirium prevention, while individuals with mental health and or other 
      psychosocial stressors may derive particular benefit from multidisciplinary care and 
      preadmission discharge planning. Robust trials are still required to provide 
      definitive evidence supporting these interventions and minimal data are available to 
      guide management during the intra- and postoperative phases. Improving the care and 
      outcomes of older people with frailty represents a key opportunity for 
      anesthesiologists and perioperative scientists.

TI  - Pain Management for Patients With Advanced Cancer in the Opioid Epidemic Era.
PG  - 24-35
LID - 10.1200/EDBK_100020 [doi]
AB  - Use of opioids for the treatment of pain is necessary for the majority of patients 
      with advanced cancer, however its use has become challenging in the face of the 
      opioid epidemic and the emerging evidence that patients with cancer are also at risk 
      for nonmedical opioid use. This article proposes an assessment and treatment plan 
      that incorporates universal screening with monitoring for all patients with cancer 
      who are considered for opioid treatment to assess their risk for opioid misuse and 
      harm. Timely identification with appropriate management, including referral of 
      at-risk patients, will allow oncology professionals to optimize the risk-to-benefit 
      and support the safe use of opioids for patients with cancer.

      Survivorship Care Guideline.
PG  - 611-35
LID - 10.1200/JCO.2015.64.3809 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of the American Cancer Society/American Society of Clinical Oncology 
      Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline is to provide recommendations to assist 
      primary care and other clinicians in the care of female adult survivors of breast 
      cancer. A systematic review of the literature was conducted using PubMed through 
      April 2015. A multidisciplinary expert workgroup with expertise in primary care, 
      gynecology, surgical oncology, medical oncology, radiation oncology, and nursing was 
      formed and tasked with drafting the Breast Cancer Survivorship Care Guideline. A 
      total of 1,073 articles met inclusion criteria; and, after full text review, 237 
      were included as the evidence base. Patients should undergo regular surveillance for 
      breast cancer recurrence, including evaluation with a cancer-related history and 
      physical examination, and should be screened for new primary breast cancer. Data do 
      not support performing routine laboratory tests or imaging tests in asymptomatic 
      patients to evaluate for breast cancer recurrence. Primary care clinicians should 
      counsel patients about the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle, monitor 
      for post-treatment symptoms that can adversely affect quality of life, and monitor 
      for adherence to endocrine therapy. Recommendations provided in this guideline are 
      based on current evidence in the literature and expert consensus opinion. Most of 
      the evidence is not sufficient to warrant a strong evidence-based recommendation. 
      Recommendations on surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, screening for second 
      primary cancers, assessment and management of physical and psychosocial long-term 
      and late effects of breast cancer and its treatment, health promotion, and care 
      coordination/practice implications are made.This guideline was developed through a 
      collaboration between the American Cancer Society and the American Society of 
      Clinical Oncology and has been published jointly by invitation and consent in both 
      CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians and Journal of Clinical Oncology. All rights

AB  - BACKGROUND: The non-prescription medication paracetamol (acetaminophen, APAP) is 
      currently recommended as a safe pain and fever treatment during pregnancy. However, 
      recent studies suggest a possible association between APAP use in pregnancy and 
      offspring neurodevelopment. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a review of publications 
      reporting associations between prenatal APAP use and offspring neurodevelopmental 
      outcomes. METHODS: Relevant sources were identified through a key word search of 
      multiple databases (Medline, CINAHL, OVID and TOXNET) in September 2016. All English 
      language observational studies of pregnancy APAP and three classes of 
      neurodevelopmental outcomes (autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit 
      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and intelligence quotient (IQ)) were included. One 
      reviewer (AZB) independently screened all titles and abstracts, extracted and 
      analyzed the data. RESULTS: 64 studies were retrieved and 55 were ineligible. Nine 
      prospective cohort studies fulfilled all inclusion criteria. Data pooling was not 
      appropriate due to heterogeneity in outcomes. All included studies suggested an 
      association between prenatal APAP exposure and the neurodevelopmental outcomes; 
      ADHD, ASD, or lower IQ. Longer duration of APAP use was associated with increased 
      risk. Associations were strongest for hyperactivity and attention-related outcomes. 
      Little modification of associations by indication for use was reported. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Together, these nine studies suggest an increased risk of adverse neurodevelopmental 
      outcomes following prenatal APAP exposure. Further studies are urgently needed with; 
      precise indication of use and exposure assessment of use both in utero and in early 
      life. Given the current findings, pregnant women should be cautioned against 
      indiscriminate use of APAP. These results have substantial public health 
      implications.

LID - 8341426
AB  - Carcinoid syndrome (CS) develops in patients with hormone-producing neuroendocrine 
      neoplasms (NENs) when hormones reach a significant level in the systemic 
      circulation. The classical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome are flushing, diarrhoea, 
      abdominal pain, and wheezing. Neuroendocrine neoplasms can produce multiple 
      hormones: 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) is the most well-known one, but histamine, 
      catecholamines, and brady/tachykinins are also released. Serotonin overproduction 
      can lead to symptoms and also stimulates fibrosis formation which can result in 
      development of carcinoid syndrome-associated complications such as carcinoid heart 
      disease (CaHD) and mesenteric fibrosis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) is 
      one of the main factors in developing fibrosis, but platelet-derived growth factor 
      (PDGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2), and connective tissue growth factor 
      (CTGF or CCN2) are also related to fibrosis development. Treatment of CS focuses on 
      reducing serotonin levels with somatostatin analogues (SSA's). Telotristat ethyl and 
      peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) have recently become available for 
      patients with symptoms despite being established on SSA's. Screening for CaHD is 
      advised, and early intervention prolongs survival. Mesenteric fibrosis is often 
      present and associated with poorer survival, but the role for prophylactic surgery 
      of this is unclear. Depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment are frequently 
      present symptoms in patients with CS but not always part of their care plan. The 
      role of antidepressants, mainly SSRIs, is debatable, but recent retrospective 
      studies show evidence for safe use in patients with CS. Carcinoid crisis is a 
      life-threatening complication of CS which can appear spontaneously but mostly 
      described during surgery, anaesthesia, chemotherapy, PRRT, and radiological 
      procedures and may be prevented by octreotide administration.

TI  - Joint disease in haemophilia: Pathophysiology, pain and imaging.
PG  - 44-49
LID - 10.1111/hae.13449 [doi]
AB  - Haemarthroses cause major morbidity in patients with haemophilia. Blood has 
      devastating effects on all joint components, resulting in synovitis, osteochondral 
      degeneration and ultimately end-stage haemophilic arthropathy. Key players in this 
      process are iron and inflammation. Preventing joint bleeds is of utmost importance 
      to maintain joint health as targeted therapies directed against blood-induced 
      inflammation and iron-mediated processes are lacking. Joint bleeds result in acute 
      pain as well as chronic pain due to synovitis or arthropathy. Acute pain originates 
      from nociceptors activated by tissue damage. In chronic inflammation, central and 
      peripheral sensitization of nociceptors might occur resulting in chronic pain. This 
      also triggers a series of brain disorders such as emotional fear, anxiety, mood 
      depression and impairment of cognitive functions. Treatment of haemophilia-related 
      pain not only consists of analgesics, but also of exercise, education and in 
      selected cases antidepressants and anticonvulsants. For objective assessment of 
      joint structural outcome and detecting earlier changes of haemophilic arthropathy, 
      both ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging have shown valuable. Both 
      can be considered equally able to reveal signs of disease activity. MR imaging is 
      able to visualize haemosiderin deposition and is more comprehensive in depicting 
      osteochondral changes. Disadvantages of MR imaging are the duration of the 
      examination, evaluation of a single joint at a time, costs and may require sedation, 
      and it may need intraarticular contrast injection to depict initial osteochondral 
      changes with accuracy. As such, US is a more useful screening tool and can be used 
      for repeated follow-up examinations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence relating to nonpharmacological approaches in the 
      management of pain during labour and delivery. To formulate recommendations for the 
      usage of nonpharmacological approaches to pain management. OPTIONS: 
      Nonpharmacological methods available for pain management during labour and delivery 
      exist. These should be included in the counselling and care of women. EVIDENCE: 
      PubMed and Medline were searched for articles in French and English on subjects 
      related to "breastfeeding," "pain," "epidural," "anaesthesia," "analgesia," 
      "labour," "labor," and combined with "gate control theory," "alternative therapies," 
      "massage," "position," "mobility," "TENS," "bathing," "DNIC," "acupuncture," 
      "acupressure," "sterile water injection," "higher center," "control mind," 
      "cognitive structuring," "holistic health," "complementary therapy(ies)," 
      "breathing," "relaxation," "mental imagery," "visualization," "mind focusing," 
      "hypnosis," "auto-hypnosis," "sophrology," "mind and body interventions," "music," 
      "odors," "biofeedback," "Lamaze," "Bonapace," "prenatal training," "gymnastic," 
      "chanting," "haptonomy," "environment," "transcutaneous electrical 
      stimulus-stimulation," "antenatal education," "support," "continuous support," 
      "psychosocial support," "psychosomatic medicine," "supportive care," "companion," 
      "intrapartum care," "nurse," "midwife(ves)," "father," "doula," "caregiver," " 
      hormones," "oxytocin," "endorphin," "prolactin," "catecholamine," "adrenaline," and 
      "noradrenaline" from 1990 to December 2015. Additional studies were identified by 
      screening reference lists from selected studies and from expert suggestions. No 
      language restrictions were applied. VALIDATION METHODS: The quality of the evidence 
      is rated using the criteria described in the Report of the Canadian Task Force on 
      Preventive Health Care. Recommendations for practice are ranked according to the 
      method described in this report. BENEFITS, RISKS, AND COST: The nonpharmacological 
      method encourages an incremental approach to pain management that contributes to 
      reduced interventions through optimal use of the woman's neurophysiologic and 
      endocrine resources and a better understanding of the physiology of stress and pain 
      during labour. GUIDELINE UPDATE: The guideline will be reviewed 5 years after 
      publication to decide whether all of part of the guideline should be updated. 
      However, if important new evidence is published prior to the 5-year cycles, the 
      review process may be accelerated for a more rapid update of some recommendations. 
      SPONSORS: This guideline was developed with resources funded by The Society of 
      Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. SUMMARY STATEMENTS: RECOMMENDATIONS.

AB  - Delirium is a syndrome characterised by an acute and fluctuating alteration in 
      cognition and awareness. It occurs frequently in children with serious medical 
      illness, and is associated with adverse outcomes such as increased length of 
      hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital costs, and mortality. 
      Delirium-especially the hypoactive subtype-is often overlooked by paediatric 
      practitioners, but can be reduced by mitigating risks and effectively managed if 
      detected early. Non-modifiable risk factors of delirium include young age (age <2 
      years), cognitive or neurological disabilities, need for invasive mechanical 
      ventilation, severe underlying illness and pre-existing chronic conditions, and poor 
      nutritional status. Routine bedside screening using validated tools can enable early 
      detection of delirium. To reduce delirium in hospitalised children, health-care 
      providers should optimise the hospital environment (eg, by reducing sleep disruption 
      and keeping the child stimulated during the day), improve pain management, and 
      decrease sedation (particularly use of benzodiazepines).

TI  - Meta-analysis of cognitive performance in fibromyalgia.
PG  - 698-714
LID - 10.1080/13803395.2017.1422699 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibromyalgia is a condition with symptoms of pain, physical function 
      difficulties, and emotional problems, but is also characterized by complaints of 
      poor cognition (often called "FibroFog"). Over the last two decades, a number of 
      studies have examined cognitive differences between individuals with and without 
      fibromyalgia. The purpose of the current study was to conduct a quantitative 
      synthesis of these differences across multiple cognitive domains. METHOD: Following 
      Cochrane guidelines, we identified 37 eligible studies for analysis where persons 
      with fibromyalgia (total n = 964) were compared to participants from age-matched 
      control groups without fibromyalgia (total n = 1025) on a range of 
      neuropsychological measures. Group differences between persons with fibromyalgia and 
      healthy controls were examined for cognitive domains including processing speed, 
      long- and short-term memory, and executive functions (inhibitory control, set 
      shifting, updating, and accessing). Random-effect meta-analyses were conducted to 
      determine effect sizes for these differences in cognitive performance. RESULTS: 
      Fibromyalgia was significantly and negatively associated with performance on all 
      domains of cognitive function. The largest effect size was found for inhibitory 
      control (g = 0.61), followed by memory (g = 0.51 for short-term, 0.50 for long-term 
      memory). The smallest cognitive difference between those with fibromyalgia and 
      controls was for set shifting (g = 0.30). CONCLUSION: These findings support the 
      hypothesis that the self-reported cognitive impact of fibromyalgia is also found in 
      objective neuropsychological measures. Routine screening for cognitive dysfunction 
      in those with fibromyalgia may be warranted in addition to assessment of the 
      traditional fibromyalgia symptoms.

TI  - Sleep Health Promotion: Practical Information for Physical Therapists.
PG  - 826-836
LID - 10.1093/ptj/pzx057 [doi]
AB  - Sleep disturbances occur in one third of the US population, and the Centers for 
      Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control 
      has deemed insufficient sleep to be a public health problem. Knowledge about sleep 
      and skills to screen sleep disorders and to promote sleep health have been 
      recommended for physical therapists. Furthermore, in survey studies, physical 
      therapists overwhelmingly agree that sleep is important for health and poor sleep 
      impairs function. Sleep is critical for the proper functioning of the body, 
      including immune function, tissue healing, pain modulation, cardiovascular health, 
      cognitive function, and learning and memory. Sleep disruptions occur across the life 
      span and in individuals with various conditions that are typically treated by 
      physical therapists. Therefore, the purpose of this perspective paper is to (1) 
      discuss the relevance of sleep to physical therapist practice, (2) recommend tools 
      to screen for the 3 most common sleep disorders, and (3) provide suggestions for how 
      therapists can integrate sleep health in prevention, health promotion, and wellness 
      interventions.

PG  - 126
LID - 10.1186/s13643-016-0300-y [doi]
LID - 126
AB  - BACKGROUND: This evidence map describes the volume and focus of Tai Chi research 
      reporting health outcomes. Originally developed as a martial art, Tai Chi is 
      typically taught as a series of slow, low-impact movements that integrate the 
      breath, mind, and physical activity to achieve greater awareness and a sense of 
      well-being. METHODS: The evidence map is based on a systematic review of systematic 
      reviews. We searched 11 electronic databases from inception to February 2014, 
      screened reviews of reviews, and consulted with topic experts. We used a bubble plot 
      to graphically display clinical topics, literature size, number of reviews, and a 
      broad estimate of effectiveness. RESULTS: The map is based on 107 systematic 
      reviews. Two thirds of the reviews were published in the last five years. The topics 
      with the largest number of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were 
      general health benefits (51 RCTs), psychological well-being (37 RCTs), interventions 
      for older adults (31 RCTs), balance (27 RCTs), hypertension (18 RCTs), fall 
      prevention (15 RCTs), and cognitive performance (11 RCTs). The map identified a 
      number of areas with evidence of a potentially positive treatment effect on patient 
      outcomes, including Tai Chi for hypertension, fall prevention outside of 
      institutions, cognitive performance, osteoarthritis, depression, chronic obstructive 
      pulmonary disease, pain, balance confidence, and muscle strength. However, 
      identified reviews cautioned that firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to 
      methodological limitations in the original studies and/or an insufficient number of 
      existing research studies. CONCLUSIONS: Tai Chi has been applied in diverse clinical 
      areas, and for a number of these, systematic reviews have indicated promising 
      results. The evidence map provides a visual overview of Tai Chi research volume and 
      content. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42014009907.

TI  - The ICM research agenda on intensive care unit-acquired weakness.
PG  - 1270-1281
LID - 10.1007/s00134-017-4757-5 [doi]
AB  - We present areas of uncertainty concerning intensive care unit-acquired weakness 
      (ICUAW) and identify areas for future research. Age, pre-ICU functional and 
      cognitive state, concurrent illness, frailty, and health trajectories impact 
      outcomes and should be assessed to stratify patients. In the ICU, early assessment 
      of limb and diaphragm muscle strength and function using nonvolitional tests may be 
      useful, but comparison with established methods of global and specific muscle 
      strength and physical function and determination of their reliability and normal 
      values would be important to advance these techniques. Serial measurements of limb 
      and respiratory muscle strength, and systematic screening for dysphagia, would be 
      helpful to clarify if and how weakness of these muscle groups is independently 
      associated with outcome. ICUAW, delirium, and sedatives and analgesics may interact 
      with each other, amplifying the effects of each individual factor. Reduced mobility 
      in patients with hypoactive delirium needs investigations into dysfunction of 
      central and peripheral nervous system motor pathways. Interventional nutritional 
      studies should include muscle mass, strength, and physical function as outcomes, and 
      prioritize elucidation of mechanisms. At follow-up, ICU survivors may suffer from 
      prolonged muscle weakness and wasting and other physical impairments, as well as 
      fatigue without demonstrable weakness on examination. Further studies should 
      evaluate the prevalence and severity of fatigue in ICU survivors and define its 
      association with psychiatric disorders, pain, cognitive impairment, and axonal loss. 
      Finally, methodological issues, including accounting for baseline status, handling 
      of missing data, and inclusion of patient-centered outcome measures should be 
      addressed in future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-school children spend an average of two-hours daily using screens. 
      We examined associations between screen-time on pre-school behavior using data from 
      the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. METHODS: CHILD 
      participant parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) at five-years of 
      age. Parents reported their child's total screen-time including gaming and mobile 
      devices. Screen-time was categorized using the recommended threshold of 
      two-hours/day for five-years or one-hour/day for three-years. Multiple linear 
      regression examined associations between screen-time and externalizing behavior 
      (e.g. inattention and aggression). Multiple logistic regression identified 
      characteristics of children at risk for clinically significant externalizing 
      problems (CBCL T-score≥65). RESULTS: Screen-time was available for over 95% of 
      children (2,322/2,427) with CBCL data. Mean screen-time was 1·4 hours/day (95%CI 
      1·4, 1·5) at five-years and 1·5 hours/day (95%CI: 1·5, 1·6) at three-years. Compared 
      to children with less than 30-minutes/day screen-time, those watching more than 
      two-hours/day (13·7%) had a 2·2-point increase in externalizing T-score (95%CI: 0·9, 
      3·5, p≤0·001); a five-fold increased odd for reporting clinically significant 
      externalizing problems (95%CI: 1·0, 25·0, p = 0·05); and were 5·9 times more likely 
      to report clinically significant inattention problems (95%CI: 1·6, 21·5, p = 0·01). 
      Children with a DSM-5 ADHD T-score above the 65 clinical cut-off were considered to 
      have significant ADHD type symptoms (n = 24). Children with more than 2-hours of 
      screen-time/day had a 7·7-fold increased risk of meeting criteria for ADHD (95%CI: 
      1·6, 38·1, p = 0·01). There was no significant association between screen-time and 
      aggressive behaviors (p>0.05). CONCLUSION: Increased screen-time in pre-school is 
      associated with worse inattention problems.

TI  - Understanding bruxism in children and adolescents.
PG  - 489-506
AB  - Screening for the various forms of bruxism in children and adolescents requires a 
      sound knowledge of the physiopathology of this parafunction in addition to the 
      etiologic and associated factors and comorbidities. The international literature 
      contains various suggestions for suitable treatment. The optimal therapeutic 
      approach often involves multidisciplinary management of these young patients. Sleep 
      bruxism (SB) is a common sleep disorder which can cause serious problems to the 
      stomatognathic system such as damaged teeth, headaches, muscle pain and TMD. Dental 
      professionals are responsible for the detection and prevention of these harmful 
      impacts on the patient's oral health. However, SB is much more than a question of 
      worn teeth. Patients with SB consult for other medical comorbidities such as 
      nighttime breathing problems, insomnia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, 
      depression, moodiness and gastroesophogeal reflux before any course of treatment is 
      initiated. If a comorbidity is diagnosed, the treatment approach will be aimed in 
      the first instance at the medical disorder, while concurrently managing the 
      repercussions of SB. On the other hand, in as far as the majority of young bruxers 
      cease to grind their teeth before adolescence or adulthood, it is feasible to adopt 
      wait-and-see and non-interventionist strategies for young children. However, it is 
      preferable to have a better understanding of SB, notably on account of its potential 
      association with psychological disorders during childhood. Daytime bruxism is 
      characterized by teeth clenching (TC). First-line treatment involves encouraging 
      patients to monitor their harmful parafunctional behavior and, consequently, change 
      and cease it. This protocol is not always easy to apply, particularly in younger 
      children. In such cases, cognitive-behavioral treatments and biofeedback techniques 
      can also be used in daytime bruxism.

      acidosis.
PG  - 162

LID - 162
AB  - BACKGROUND: D-lactic acidosis is characterized by brain fogginess (BF) and elevated 
      D-lactate and occurs in short bowel syndrome. Whether it occurs in patients with an 
      intact gut and unexplained gas and bloating is unknown. We aimed to determine if BF, 
      gas and bloating is associated with D-lactic acidosis and small intestinal bacterial 
      overgrowth (SIBO). METHODS: Patients with gas, bloating, BF, intact gut, and 
      negative endoscopic and radiological tests, and those without BF were evaluated. 
      SIBO was assessed with glucose breath test (GBT) and duodenal aspiration/culture. 
      Metabolic assessments included urinary D-lactic acid and blood L-lactic acid, and 
      ammonia levels. Bowel symptoms, and gastrointestinal transit were assessed. RESULTS: 
      Thirty patients with BF and 8 without BF were evaluated. Abdominal bloating, pain, 
      distension and gas were the most severe symptoms and their prevalence was similar 
      between groups. In BF group, all consumed probiotics. SIBO was more prevalent in BF 
      than non-BF group (68 vs. 28%, p = 0.05). D-lactic acidosis was more prevalent in BF 
      compared to non-BF group (77 vs. 25%, p = 0.006). BF was reproduced in 20/30 (66%) 
      patients. Gastrointestinal transit was slow in 10/30 (33%) patients with BF and 2/8 
      (25%) without. Other metabolic tests were unremarkable. After discontinuation of 
      probiotics and a course of antibiotics, BF resolved and gastrointestinal symptoms 
      improved significantly (p = 0.005) in 23/30 (77%). CONCLUSIONS: We describe a 
      syndrome of BF, gas and bloating, possibly related to probiotic use, SIBO, and 
      D-lactic acidosis in a cohort without short bowel. Patients with BF exhibited higher 
      prevalence of SIBO and D-lactic acidosis. Symptoms improved with antibiotics and 
      stopping probiotics. Clinicians should recognize and treat this condition.

AB  - In the mid 1960s, experimental work on molecules under screening as coronary 
      dilators allowed the discovery of the mechanism of calcium entry blockade by drugs 
      later named calcium channel blockers. This paper summarizes scientific research on 
      these small molecules interacting directly with L-type voltage-operated calcium 
      channels. It also reports on experimental approaches translated into understanding 
      of their therapeutic actions. The importance of calcium in muscle contraction was 
      discovered by Sidney Ringer who reported this fact in 1883. Interest in the 
      intracellular role of calcium arose 60 years later out of Kamada (Japan) and 
      Heibrunn (USA) experiments in the early 1940s. Studies on pharmacology of calcium 
      function were initiated in the mid 1960s and their therapeutic applications globally 
      occurred in the the 1980s. The first part of this report deals with basic 
      pharmacology in the cardiovascular system particularly in isolated arteries. In the 
      section entitled from calcium antagonists to calcium channel blockers, it is 
      recalled that drugs of a series of diphenylpiperazines screened in vivo on coronary 
      bed precontracted by angiotensin were initially named calcium antagonists on the 
      basis of their effect in depolarized arteries contracted by calcium. Studies on 
      arteries contracted by catecholamines showed that the vasorelaxation resulted from 
      blockade of calcium entry. Radiochemical and electrophysiological studies performed 
      with dihydropyridines allowed their cellular targets to be identified with L-type 
      voltage-operated calcium channels. The modulated receptor theory helped the 
      understanding of their variation in affinity dependent on arterial cell membrane 
      potential and promoted the terminology calcium channel blocker (CCB) of which the 
      various chemical families are introduced in the paper. In the section entitled 
      tissue selectivity of CCBs, it is shown that characteristics of the drug, properties 
      of the tissue, and of the stimuli are important factors of their action. The high 
      sensitivity of hypertensive animals is explained by the partial depolarization of 
      their arteries. It is noted that they are arteriolar dilators and that they cannot 
      be simply considered as vasodilators. The second part of this report provides key 
      information about clinical usefulness of CCBs. A section is devoted to the 
      controversy on their safety closed by the Allhat trial (2002). Sections are 
      dedicated to their effect in cardiac ischemia, in cardiac arrhythmias, in 
      atherosclerosis, in hypertension, and its complications. CCBs appear as the most 
      commonly used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. As far as hypertension 
      is concerned, globally the prevalence in adults aged 25 years and over was around 
      40% in 2008. Usefulness of CCBs is discussed on the basis of large clinical trials. 
      At therapeutic dosage, they reduce the elevated blood pressure of hypertensive 
      patients but don't change blood pressure of normotensive subjects, as was observed 
      in animals. Those active on both L- and T-type channels are efficient in 
      nephropathy. Alteration of cognitive function is a complication of hypertension 
      recognized nowadays as eventually leading to dementia. This question is discussed 
      together with the efficacy of CCBs in cognitive pathology. In the section entitled 
      beyond the cardiovascular system, CCBs actions in migraine, neuropathic pain, and 
      subarachnoid hemorrhage are reported. The final conclusions refer to long-term 
      effects discovered in experimental animals that have not yet been clearly reported 
      as being important in human pharmacotherapy.

TI  - Comprehensive behavioral analysis of heterozygous Syngap1 knockout mice.
PG  - 223-237
LID - 10.1002/npr2.12073 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: Synaptic Ras GTPase-activating protein 1 (SYNGAP1) regulates synaptic 
      plasticity through AMPA receptor trafficking. SYNGAP1 mutations have been found in 
      human patients with intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 
      Almost every individual with SYNGAP1-related ID develops epilepsy, and approximately 
      50% have ASD. SYNGAP1-related ID is estimated to account for at least 1% of ID 
      cases. In mouse models with Syngap1 mutations, strong cognitive and affective 
      dysfunctions have been reported, yet some findings are inconsistent across studies. 
      To further understand the behavioral significance of the SYNGAP1 gene, we assessed 
      various domains of behavior in Syngap1 heterozygous mutant mice using a behavioral 
      test battery. METHODS: Male mice with a heterozygous mutation in the Syngap1 gene 
      (Syngap1(-/+) mice) created by Seth Grant's group were subjected to a battery of 
      comprehensive behavioral tests, which examined general health, and neurological 
      screens, rotarod, hot plate, open field, light/dark transition, elevated plus maze, 
      social interaction, prepulse inhibition, Porsolt forced swim, tail suspension, gait 
      analysis, T-maze, Y-maze, Barnes maze, contextual and cued fear conditioning, and 
      home cage locomotor activity. To control for type I errors due to 
      multiple-hypothesis testing, P-values below the false discovery rate calculated by 
      the Benjamini-Hochberg method were considered as study-wide statistically 
      significant. RESULTS: Syngap1(-/+) mice showed increased locomotor activity, 
      decreased prepulse inhibition, and impaired working and reference spatial memory, 
      consistent with preceding studies. Impairment of context fear memory and increased 
      startle reflex in Syngap1 mutant mice could not be reproduced. Significant decreases 
      in sensitivity to painful stimuli and impaired motor function were observed in 
      Syngap1(-/+) mice. Decreased anxiety-like behavior and depression-like behavior were 
      noted, although increased locomotor activity is a potential confounding factor of 
      these phenotypes. Increased home cage locomotor activity indicated hyperlocomotor 
      activity not only in specific behavioral test conditions but also in familiar 
      environments. CONCLUSION: In Syngap1(-/+) mice, we could reproduce most of the 
      previously reported cognitive and emotional deficits. The decreased sensitivity to 
      painful stimuli and impaired motor function that we found in Syngap1(-/+) mice are 
      consistent with the common characteristics of patients with SYNGAP-related ID. We 
      further confirmed that the Syngap1 heterozygote mouse recapitulates the symptoms of 
      ID and ASD patients.

TI  - Management of Orthostatic Hypotension in Parkinson's Disease.
PG  - S57-S64
LID - 10.3233/JPD-202036 [doi]
AB  - Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is a common non-motor feature of Parkinson's disease 
      that may cause unexplained falls, syncope, lightheadedness, cognitive impairment, 
      dyspnea, fatigue, blurred vision, shoulder, neck, or low-back pain upon standing. 
      Blood pressure (BP) measurements supine and after 3 minutes upon standing screen for 
      OH at bedside. The medical history and cardiovascular autonomic function tests 
      ultimately distinguish neurogenic OH, which is due to impaired sympathetic nerve 
      activity, from non-neurogenic causes of OH, such as hypovolemia and BP lowering 
      drugs. The correction of non-neurogenic causes and exacerbating factors, lifestyle 
      changes and non-pharmacological measures are the cornerstone of OH treatment. If 
      these measures fail, pharmacological interventions (sympathomimetic agents and/or 
      fludrocortisone) should be introduced stepwise depending on the severity of 
      symptoms. About 50% of patients with neurogenic OH also suffer from supine and 
      nocturnal hypertension, which should be monitored for with in-office, home and 24 
      h-ambulatory BP measurements. Behavioral measures help prevent supine hypertension, 
      which is eventually treated with non-pharmacological measures and bedtime 
      administration of short-acting anti-hypertensive drugs in severe cases. If left 
      untreated, OH impacts on activity of daily living and increases the risk of syncope 
      and falls. Supine hypertension is asymptomatic, but often limits an effective 
      treatment of OH, increases the risk of hypertensive emergencies and, combined with 
      OH, facilitates end-organ damage. A timely management of both OH and supine 
      hypertension ameliorates quality of life and prevents short and long-term 
      complications in patients with Parkinson's disease.

TI  - Factors associated with ADL/IADL disability in community dwelling older adults in 
      the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA).
PG  - 809-816
LID - 10.3109/09638288.2016.1161848 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the factors associated with disability across many domains 
      using a large powered sample in the activities of daily living (ADL) and 
      instrumental activities of daily living (IADL). METHODS: Those aged ≥65 years from 
      the Irish longitudinal study on ageing (TILDA) were included in this cross sectional 
      analysis. Three logistic regression models were used to examine the relationships 
      between 25 health, psychological and sociodemographic variables and difficulties in 
      ADL, IADL and ADL/IADL combined. RESULTS: The proportion of those reporting combined 
      ADL/IADL difficulties was 18%. More individuals reported difficulty with ADLs (13%) 
      than IADLS (11%). The main model showed that after age, the top three factors 
      associated with difficulty in ADL/IADL combined were pain, taking five or more 
      medications and depression. After age, the factors with the highest impact on ADL 
      disability were pain, taking five or more medications and body mass index (BMI); the 
      factors with the highest impact on IADL were being separated or divorced, living 
      with others (non-spouse) and self-rated memory. CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of 
      sociodemographics and early interventions for pain and cognitive deficits could 
      reduce ADL/IADL disability and promote successful ageing. Identification of 
      variables that influence ADL/IADLs can be used to inform policy and practice. 
      Implications for rehabilitation After age, pain and taking five or more medications 
      were the strongest factors associated with difficulty in ADL/IADL combined and ADL 
      alone. Practice therefore needs to be cognizant that it is not the disease label but 
      the symptoms of a disease that affect ADL and IADL activities. Given the strong 
      influence of pain on difficulties with ADL and IADL, there is a need for early 
      interventions from a multidisciplinary perspective for pain reduction, control, and 
      self-management. These interventions should include development of pain-coping 
      strategies and exercises to maintain mobility. After age, being separated/divorced 
      or living with non-spouse others are the strongest factors associated with IADL 
      difficulties. Awareness of these social factors can be used to inform support 
      mechanisms, such as development of community services and suitable housing for those 
      with these changing sociodemographics. Unsurprisingly, cognitive impairments were 
      strongly associated with IADL difficulties. Simple cognitive screening assessments 
      could be used for early detection of cognitive changes. In order to maintain optimal 
      cognitive functioning, rehabilitation professionals should facilitate older adults' 
      engagement in activities that are cognitively demanding and socially interactive.

      Focused Ultrasound Technology: Advances in Diagnosis and Treatment.
PG  - 246-254
LID - 10.1001/jamaneurol.2017.3129 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound ablation has been 
      approved for the treatment of refractory essential tremor and is being studied for 
      other neurological indications, including dyskinesias and tremor in Parkinson 
      disease, dystonia, neuropathic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, epilepsy, and 
      brain tumors. OBJECTIVE: To review the scientific foundations of FUS technology, 
      existing neurological applications, and future advances. EVIDENCE REVIEW: PubMed was 
      searched for the past 10 years using the terms "transcranial ultrasound," "focused 
      ultrasound," and "neurological applications." Relevant references were selected from 
      the author's reference collection. From the 2855 unique records, 243 publications 
      were screened. After excluding abstracts detailing in vitro studies or 
      non-neurological applications, 86 full texts were retrieved for qualitative review. 
      FINDINGS: Advances in the transducer design and electronic phase correction have 
      allowed efficient focusing of ultrasounds for transcranial treatment. The 
      mid-frequency (650 kHz) transducer can make small (4-6 mm in diameter) and precise 
      (accuracy of <2 mm) brain lesions. The treatment monitoring is achieved via "live" 
      anatomical thermography imaging and clinical feedback. The initial results from its 
      clinical application in movement disorders are encouraging. Emerging applications in 
      epilepsy and neurobehavioral and cognitive disorders are being explored. The 
      low-frequency (220 kHz) transducer coupled with microbubbles can potentially enable 
      targeted drug delivery for novel applications, such as Alzheimer disease and brain 
      tumors. Finally, neuromodulation with subthreshold sonications may allow the 
      interrogation of brain areas previously not accessible for electrical stimulation. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Transcranial focused ultrasound for both ablative and 
      nonablative applications is noninvasive, making it suitable for selected patients 
      who are not candidates for conventional surgical options. Future advancements in 
      imaging and sonication algorithms will improve the safety and efficacy of this 
      technology.

TI  - Work-break schedules for preventing musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in 
      healthy workers.
PG  - CD012886
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012886.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012886
AB  - BACKGROUND: Work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a group of musculoskeletal 
      disorders that comprise one of the most common disorders related to occupational 
      sick leave worldwide. Musculoskeletal disorders accounted for 21% to 28% of work 
      absenteeism days in 2017/2018 in the Netherlands, Germany and the UK. There are 
      several interventions that may be effective in tackling the high prevalence of 
      work-related musculoskeletal disorders among workers, such as physical, cognitive 
      and organisational interventions. In this review, we will focus on work breaks as a 
      measure of primary prevention, which are a type of organisational intervention. 
      OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different work-break schedules for 
      preventing work-related musculoskeletal symptoms and disorders in healthy workers, 
      when compared to conventional or alternate work-break schedules. SEARCH METHODS: We 
      searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, 
      Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World 
      Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, to April/May 
      2019. In addition, we searched references of the included studies and of relevant 
      literature reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials 
      (RCTs) of work-break interventions for preventing work-related musculoskeletal 
      symptoms and disorders among workers. The studies were eligible for inclusion when 
      intervening on work-break frequency, duration and/or type, compared to conventional 
      or an alternate work-break intervention. We included only those studies in which the 
      investigated population included healthy, adult workers, who were free of 
      musculoskeletal complaints during study enrolment, without restrictions to sex or 
      occupation. The primary outcomes were newly diagnosed musculoskeletal disorders, 
      self-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue, and productivity or work 
      performance. We considered workload changes as secondary outcomes. DATA COLLECTION 
      AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full 
      texts for study eligibility, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted 
      authors for additional study data where required. We performed meta-analyses, where 
      possible, and we assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each outcome of 
      each comparison using the five GRADE considerations. MAIN RESULTS: We included six 
      studies (373 workers), four parallel RCTs, one cross-over RCT, and one combined 
      parallel plus cross-over RCT. At least 295 of the employees were female and at least 
      39 male; for the remaining 39 employees, the sex was not specified in the study 
      trial. The studies investigated different work-break frequencies (five studies) and 
      different work-break types (two studies). None of the studies investigated different 
      work-break durations. We judged all studies to have a high risk of bias. The quality 
      of the evidence for the primary outcomes of self-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
      discomfort and fatigue was low; the quality of the evidence for the primary outcomes 
      of productivity and work performance was very low. The studies were executed in 
      Europe or Northern America, with none from low- to middle-income countries. One 
      study could not be included in the data analyses, because no detailed results have 
      been reported.Changes in the frequency of work breaksThere is low-quality evidence 
      that additional work breaks may not have a considerable effect on musculoskeletal 
      pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared with no additional work breaks 
      (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.08; 95% CI -0.35 to 0.18; three studies; 225 
      participants). Additional breaks may not have a positive effect on productivity or 
      work performance, when compared with no additional work breaks (SMD -0.07; 95% CI 
      -0.33 to 0.19; three studies; 225 participants; very low-quality evidence).We found 
      low-quality evidence that additional work breaks may not have a considerable effect 
      on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or fatigue (MD 1.80 on a 
      100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 15 participants), when compared 
      to work breaks as needed (i.e. microbreaks taken at own discretion). There is very 
      low-quality evidence that additional work breaks may have a positive effect on 
      productivity or work performance, when compared to work breaks as needed (MD 542.5 
      number of words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% CI 177.22 to 907.78; one 
      study; 15 participants).Additional higher frequency work breaks may not have a 
      considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, discomfort or 
      fatigue (MD 11.65 on a 100-mm VAS scale; 95% CI -41.07 to 64.37; one study; 10 
      participants; low-quality evidence), when compared to additional lower frequency 
      work breaks. We found very low-quality evidence that additional higher frequency 
      work breaks may not have a considerable effect on productivity or work performance 
      (MD -83.00 number of words typed per 3-hour recording session; 95% CI -305.27 to 
      139.27; one study; 10 participants), when compared to additional lower frequency 
      work breaks.Changes in the duration of work breaksNo trials were identified that 
      assessed the effect of different durations of work breaks.Changes in the type of 
      work breakWe found low-quality evidence that active breaks may not have a 
      considerable positive effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
      discomfort and fatigue (MD -0.17 on a 1-7 NRS scale; 95% CI -0.71 to 0.37; one 
      study; 153 participants), when compared to passive work breaks.Relaxation work 
      breaks may not have a considerable effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal 
      pain, discomfort or fatigue, when compared to physical work breaks (MD 0.20 on a 1-7 
      NRS scale; 95% CI -0.43 to 0.82; one study; 97 participants; low-quality evidence). 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found low-quality evidence that different work-break 
      frequencies may have no effect on participant-reported musculoskeletal pain, 
      discomfort and fatigue. For productivity and work performance, evidence was of very 
      low-quality that different work-break frequencies may have a positive effect. For 
      different types of break, there may be no effect on participant-reported 
      musculoskeletal pain, discomfort and fatigue according to low-quality evidence. 
      Further high-quality studies are needed to determine the effectiveness of frequency, 
      duration and type of work-break interventions among workers, if possible, with much 
      higher sample sizes than the studies included in the current review. Furthermore, 
      work-break interventions should be reconsidered, taking into account worker 
      populations other than office workers, and taking into account the possibility of 
      combining work-break intervention with other interventions such as ergonomic 
      training or counselling, which may may possibly have an effect on musculoskeletal 
      outcomes and work performance.

TI  - Effects of screentime on the health and well-being of children and adolescents: a 
      systematic review of reviews.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To systematically examine the evidence of harms and benefits relating to 
      time spent on screens for children and young people's (CYP) health and well-being, 
      to inform policy. METHODS: Systematic review of reviews undertaken to answer the 
      question 'What is the evidence for health and well-being effects of screentime in 
      children and adolescents (CYP)?' Electronic databases were searched for systematic 
      reviews in February 2018. Eligible reviews reported associations between time on 
      screens (screentime; any type) and any health/well-being outcome in CYP. Quality of 
      reviews was assessed and strength of evidence across reviews evaluated. RESULTS: 13 
      reviews were identified (1 high quality, 9 medium and 3 low quality). 6 addressed 
      body composition; 3 diet/energy intake; 7 mental health; 4 cardiovascular risk; 4 
      for fitness; 3 for sleep; 1 pain; 1 asthma. We found moderately strong evidence for 
      associations between screentime and greater obesity/adiposity and higher depressive 
      symptoms; moderate evidence for an association between screentime and higher energy 
      intake, less healthy diet quality and poorer quality of life. There was weak 
      evidence for associations of screentime with behaviour problems, anxiety, 
      hyperactivity and inattention, poorer self-esteem, poorer well-being and poorer 
      psychosocial health, metabolic syndrome, poorer cardiorespiratory fitness, poorer 
      cognitive development and lower educational attainments and poor sleep outcomes. 
      There was no or insufficient evidence for an association of screentime with eating 
      disorders or suicidal ideation, individual cardiovascular risk factors, asthma 
      prevalence or pain. Evidence for threshold effects was weak. We found weak evidence 
      that small amounts of daily screen use is not harmful and may have some benefits. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that higher levels of screentime is associated with a 
      variety of health harms for CYP, with evidence strongest for adiposity, unhealthy 
      diet, depressive symptoms and quality of life. Evidence to guide policy on safe CYP 
      screentime exposure is limited. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42018089483.

TI  - Comparative effectiveness of pain management interventions for hip fracture: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 234-45
LID - 10.7326/0003-4819-155-4-201108160-00346 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain management is integral to the management of hip fracture. PURPOSE: 
      To review the benefits and harms of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions 
      for managing pain after hip fracture. DATA SOURCES: 25 electronic databases (January 
      1990 to December 2010), gray literature, trial registries, and reference lists, with 
      no language restrictions. STUDY SELECTION: Multiple reviewers independently and in 
      duplicate screened 9357 citations to identify randomized, controlled trials (RCTs); 
      nonrandomized, controlled trials (non-RCTs); and cohort studies of pain management 
      techniques in older adults after acute hip fracture. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent, 
      duplicate data extraction and quality assessment were conducted, with discrepancies 
      resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. Data extracted included study 
      characteristics, inclusion and exclusion criteria, participant characteristics, 
      interventions, and outcomes. DATA SYNTHESIS: 83 unique studies (64 RCTs, 5 non-RCTs, 
      and 14 cohort studies) were included that addressed nerve blockade (n = 32), spinal 
      anesthesia (n = 30), systemic analgesia (n = 3), traction (n = 11), multimodal pain 
      management (n = 2), neurostimulation (n = 2), rehabilitation (n = 1), and 
      complementary and alternative medicine (n = 2). Overall, moderate evidence suggests 
      that nerve blockades are effective for relieving acute pain and reducing delirium. 
      Low-level evidence suggests that preoperative traction does not reduce acute pain. 
      Evidence was insufficient on the benefits and harms of most interventions, including 
      spinal anesthesia, systemic analgesia, multimodal pain management, acupressure, 
      relaxation therapy, transcutaneous electrical neurostimulation, and physical therapy 
      regimens, in managing acute pain. LIMITATIONS: No studies evaluated outcomes of 
      chronic pain or exclusively examined participants from nursing homes or with 
      cognitive impairment. Systemic analgesics (narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
      drugs) were understudied during the search period. CONCLUSION: Nerve blockade seems 
      to be effective in reducing acute pain after hip fracture. Sparse data preclude firm 
      conclusions about the relative benefits or harms of many other pain management 
      interventions for patients with hip fracture. PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE: Agency for 
      Healthcare Research and Quality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive care survivors suffer chronic and potentially life-changing 
      physical, psychosocial and cognitive sequelae, and supporting recovery is an 
      international priority. As survivors' transition from the intensive care unit to 
      home, their support needs develop and change. METHODS: In this scoping review, we 
      categorised patients' support needs using House's Social Support Needs framework 
      (informational, emotional, instrumental, appraisal) and mapped these against the 
      Timing it Right framework reflecting the patient's transition from intensive care 
      (event/diagnosis) to ward (stabilisation/preparation) and discharge home 
      (implementation/adaptation). We searched electronic databases from 2000 to 2017 for 
      qualitative research studies reporting adult critical care survivors' experiences of 
      care. Two reviewers independently screened, extracted and coded data. Data were 
      analysed using a thematic framework approach. RESULTS: From 3035 references, we 
      included 32 studies involving 702 patients. Studies were conducted in UK and Europe 
      (n = 17, 53%), Canada and the USA (n = 6, 19%), Australasia (n = 6, 19%), Hong Kong 
      (n = 1, 3%), Jordan (n = 1, 3%) and multi-country (n = 1, 3%). Across the recovery 
      trajectory, informational, emotional, instrumental, appraisal and spiritual support 
      needs were evident, and the nature and intensity of need differed when mapped 
      against the Timing it Right framework. Informational needs changed from needing 
      basic facts about admission, to detail about progress and treatments and coping with 
      long-term sequelae. The nature of emotional needs changed from needing to cope with 
      confusion, anxiety and comfort, to a need for security and family presence, coping 
      with flashbacks, and needing counselling and community support. Early instrumental 
      needs ranged from managing sleep, fatigue, pain and needing nursing care and 
      transitioned to needing physical and cognitive ability support, strength training 
      and personal hygiene; and at home, regaining independence, strength and return to 
      work. Appraisal needs related to obtaining feedback on progress, and after 
      discharge, needing reassurance from others who had been through the ICU experience. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This review is the first to identify the change in social support needs 
      among intensive care survivors as they transition from intensive care to the home 
      environment. An understanding of needs at different transition periods would help 
      inform health service provision and support for survivors.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The usual supplementation for hypothyroidism is based on monotherapy 
      with levothyroxine. However, some patients persist with symptoms attributable to the 
      deficit of thyroid hormone. It has been suggested that the a combined treatment with 
      liothyronine and levothyroxine would provide a greater benefit. METHODS: We searched 
      in Epistemonikos, the largest database of systematic reviews in health, which is 
      maintained by screening multiple information sources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, 
      Cochrane, among others. We extracted data from the systematic reviews, reanalyzed 
      data of primary studies, conducted a meta-analysis and generated a summary of 
      findings table using the GRADE approach. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified 
      three systematic reviews including twelve primary studies overall, all of which were 
      randomized trials. We concluded that the addition of liothyronine to the treatment 
      of hypothyroidism has minimal or no effect on fatigue and quality of life. It 
      probably does not improve mood, pain or function cognitive, and it would not reduce 
      body weight.

TI  - Screening for Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults: Evidence Report and Systematic 
      Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.
PG  - 415-433
LID - 10.1001/jama.2016.19635 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Many adverse health outcomes are associated with obstructive sleep apnea 
      (OSA). OBJECTIVE: To review primary care-relevant evidence on screening adults for 
      OSA, test accuracy, and treatment of OSA, to inform the US Preventive Services Task 
      Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and trial registries through 
      October 2015, references, and experts, with surveillance of the literature through 
      October 5, 2016. STUDY SELECTION: English-language randomized clinical trials 
      (RCTs); studies evaluating accuracy of screening questionnaires or prediction tools, 
      diagnostic accuracy of portable monitors, or association between apnea-hypopnea 
      index (AHI) and health outcomes among community-based participants. DATA EXTRACTION 
      AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently reviewed abstracts and full-text 
      articles. When multiple similar studies were available, random-effects meta-analyses 
      were conducted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, area under the 
      curve (AUC), AHI, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores, blood pressure, mortality, 
      cardiovascular events, motor vehicle crashes, quality of life, and harms. RESULTS: A 
      total of 110 studies were included (N = 46 188). No RCTs compared screening with no 
      screening. In 2 studies (n = 702), the screening accuracy of the multivariable apnea 
      prediction score followed by home portable monitor testing for detecting severe OSA 
      syndrome (AHI ≥30 and ESS score >10) was AUC 0.80 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.82) and 0.83 
      (95% CI, 0.77 to 0.90), respectively, but the studies oversampled high-risk 
      participants and those with OSA and OSA syndrome. No studies prospectively evaluated 
      screening tools to report calibration or clinical utility for improving health 
      outcomes. Meta-analysis found that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) 
      compared with sham was significantly associated with reduction of AHI (weighted mean 
      difference [WMD], -33.8 [95% CI, -42.0 to -25.6]; 13 trials, 543 participants), 
      excessive sleepiness assessed by ESS score (WMD, -2.0 [95% CI, -2.6 to -1.4]; 22 
      trials, 2721 participants), diurnal systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.4 points [95% 
      CI, -3.9 to -0.9]; 15 trials, 1190 participants), and diurnal diastolic blood 
      pressure (WMD, -1.3 points [95% CI, -2.2 to -0.4]; 15 trials, 1190 participants). 
      CPAP was associated with modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life (Cohen 
      d, 0.28 [95% CI, 0.14 to 0.42]; 13 trials, 2325 participants). Mandibular 
      advancement devices (MADs) and weight loss programs were also associated with 
      reduced AHI and excessive sleepiness. Common adverse effects of CPAP and MADs 
      included oral or nasal dryness, irritation, and pain, among others. In cohort 
      studies, there was a consistent association between AHI and all-cause mortality. 
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is uncertainty about the accuracy or clinical 
      utility of all potential screening tools. Multiple treatments for OSA reduce AHI, 
      ESS scores, and blood pressure. Trials of CPAP and other treatments have not 
      established whether treatment reduces mortality or improves most other health 
      outcomes, except for modest improvement in sleep-related quality of life.

TI  - Dextromethorphan and memantine after ketamine analgesia: a randomized control trial.
PG  - 2677-2688
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S207350 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Intravenous ketamine is often prescribed in severe neuropathic pain. Oral 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists might prolong pain relief, 
      reducing the frequency of ketamine infusions and hospital admissions. This clinical 
      trial aimed at assessing whether oral dextromethorphan or memantine might prolong 
      pain relief after intravenous ketamine. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A multicenter 
      randomized controlled clinical trial included 60 patients after ketamine infusion 
      for refractory neuropathic pain. Dextromethorphan (90 mg/day), memantine (20 mg/day) 
      or placebo was given for 12 weeks (n=20 each) after ketamine infusion. The primary 
      endpoint was pain intensity at one month. Secondary endpoints included pain, sleep, 
      anxiety, depression, cognitive function and quality of life evaluations up to 
      12 weeks. RESULTS: At 1 month, dextromethorphan maintained ketamine pain relief 
      (Numeric Pain Scale: 4.01±1.87 to 4.05±2.61, p=0.53) and diminished pain paroxysms 
      (p=0.03) while pain intensity increased significantly with memantine and placebo 
      (p=0.04). At 3 months, pain remained lower than at inclusion (p=0.001) and was not 
      significantly different in the three groups. Significant benefits were observed on 
      cognitive-affective domains and quality of life for dextromethorphan and memantine 
      (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Oral dextromethorphan given after ketamine infusion extends 
      pain relief during one month and could help patients to better cope with pain. 
      Future studies should include larger populations stratified on pharmacogenetics 
      screening. Optimization of an oral drug that could extend ketamine antihyperalgesia, 
      with fewer hospital admissions, remains a prime challenge in refractory neuropathic 
      pain.

TI  - Ergonomic interventions for preventing musculoskeletal disorders in dental care

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dentistry is a profession with a high prevalence of work-related 
      musculoskeletal disorders (WMSD) among practitioners, with symptoms often starting 
      as early in the career as the student phase. Ergonomic interventions in physical, 
      cognitive, and organisational domains have been suggested to prevent their 
      occurrence, but evidence of their effects remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To assess the 
      effect of ergonomic interventions for the prevention of work-related musculoskeletal 
      disorders among dental care practitioners. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, 
      MEDLINE PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO ProQuest, NIOSHTIC, NIOSHTIC-2, HSELINE, CISDOC 
      (OSH-UPDATE), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International 
      Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) Search Portal to August 2018, without 
      language or date restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, and cluster RCTs, in which participants were adults, aged 
      18 and older, who were engaged in the practice of dentistry. At least 75% of them 
      had to be free from musculoskeletal pain at baseline. We only included studies that 
      measured at least one of our primary outcomes; i.e. physician diagnosed WMSD, 
      self-reported pain, or work functioning. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three authors 
      independently screened and selected 20 potentially eligible references from 946 
      relevant references identified from the search results. Based on the full-text 
      screening, we included two studies, excluded 16 studies, and two are awaiting 
      classification. Four review authors independently extracted data, and two authors 
      assessed the risk of bias. We calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% 
      confidence intervals (CI) for continuous outcomes and risk ratios (RR) with 95% 
      confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes. We assessed the quality of the 
      evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We included two 
      RCTs (212 participants), one of which was a cluster-randomised trial. Adjusting for 
      the design effect from clustering, reduced the total sample size to 210. Both 
      studies were carried out in dental clinics and assessed ergonomic interventions in 
      the physical domain, one by evaluating a multi-faceted ergonomic intervention, which 
      consisted of imparting knowledge and training about ergonomics, work station 
      modification, training and surveying ergonomics at the work station, and a regular 
      exercise program; the other by studying the effectiveness of two different types of 
      instrument used for scaling in preventing WMSDs. We were unable to combine the 
      results from the two studies because of the diversity of interventions and 
      outcomes.Physical ergonomic interventions. Based on one study, there is very 
      low-quality evidence that a multi-faceted intervention has no clear effect on 
      dentists' risk of WMSD in the thighs (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.42; 102 
      participants), or feet (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.41; 102 participants) when 
      compared to no intervention over a six-month period. Based on one study, there is 
      low-quality evidence of no clear difference in elbow pain (MD -0.14, 95% CI -0.39 to 
      0.11; 110 participants), or shoulder pain (MD -0.32, 95% CI -0.75 to 0.11; 110 
      participants) in participants who used light weight curettes with wider handles or 
      heavier curettes with narrow handles for scaling over a 16-week period.Cognitive 
      ergonomic interventions. We found no studies evaluating the effectiveness of 
      cognitive ergonomic interventions.Organisational ergonomic interventions. We found 
      no studies evaluating the effectiveness of organisational ergonomic interventions. 
      AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is very low-quality evidence from one study showing that 
      a multi-faceted intervention has no clear effect on dentists' risk of WMSD in the 
      thighs or feet when compared to no intervention over a six-month period. This was a 
      poorly conducted study with several shortcomings and errors in statistical analysis 
      of data. There is low-quality evidence from one study showing no clear difference in 
      elbow pain or shoulder pain in participants using light weight, wider handled 
      curettes or heavier and narrow handled curettes for scaling over a 16-week period.We 
      did not find any studies evaluating the effectiveness of cognitive ergonomic 
      interventions or organisational ergonomic interventions.Our ability to draw 
      definitive conclusions is restricted by the paucity of suitable studies available to 
      us, and the high risk of bias of the studies that are available. This review 
      highlights the need for well-designed, conducted, and reported RCTs, with long-term 
      follow-up that assess prevention strategies for WMSDs among dental care 
      practitioners.

TI  - Omega-6: Omega-3 PUFA Ratio, Pain, Functioning, and Distress in Adults With Knee 
      Pain.
PG  - 182-189
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000517 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with inflammation, chronic pain, 
      functional limitations, and psychosocial distress. High omega-3 (n-3) 
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are associated with lower levels of inflammatory 
      mediators, anti-nociception, and adaptive cognitive/emotional functioning. High 
      omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs are associated with inflammation, nociception, and psychological 
      distress. While findings related to n-3 supplementation in knee OA are mixed, 
      consideration of the n-6:n-3 ratio and additional outcome measures may provide 
      improved understanding of the potential relevance of these fatty acids in OA. On the 
      basis of recommended and typical ranges of the n-6:n-3 ratio, we hypothesized that 
      in adults with knee pain, those with a high n-6:n-3 ratio would have greater 
      pain/functional limitations, experimental pain sensitivity, and psychosocial 
      distress compared with those with a low n-6:n-3 ratio. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional investigation of clinical and experimental pain and physical and 
      psychosocial functioning was completed in 167 adults ages 45 to 85 meeting knee OA 
      screening criteria. Blood samples were collected and the plasma n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio 
      determined. Quartile splits were computed and low (n=42) and high (n=41) ratio 
      groups were compared. RESULTS: The high ratio group reported greater pain and 
      functional limitations, (all Ps<0.04), mechanical temporal summation (hand and knee, 
      P<0.05), and perceived stress (P=0.008) but not depressive symptoms. DISCUSSION: In 
      adults with knee pain, a high n-6:n-3 ratio is associated with greater clinical 
      pain/functional limitations, experimental pain sensitivity, and psychosocial 
      distress compared with a low ratio group. Findings support consideration of the 
      n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio and additional clinical endpoints in future research efforts.

TI  - Daily iron supplementation for improving anaemia, iron status and health in 
      menstruating women.
PG  - CD009747
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD009747.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron-deficiency anaemia is highly prevalent among non-pregnant women of 
      reproductive age (menstruating women) worldwide, although the prevalence is highest 
      in lower-income settings. Iron-deficiency anaemia has been associated with a range 
      of adverse health outcomes, which restitution of iron stores using iron 
      supplementation has been considered likely to resolve. Although there have been many 
      trials reporting effects of iron in non-pregnant women, these trials have never been 
      synthesised in a systematic review. OBJECTIVES: To establish the evidence for 
      effects of daily supplementation with iron on anaemia and iron status, as well as on 
      physical, psychological and neurocognitive health, in menstruating women. SEARCH 
      METHODS: In November 2015 we searched CENTRAL, Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and nine other 
      databases, as well as four digital thesis repositories. In addition, we searched the 
      World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO 
      ICTRP) and reference lists of relevant reviews. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included 
      randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing daily oral iron 
      supplementation with or without a cointervention (folic acid or vitamin C), for at 
      least five days per week at any dose, to control or placebo using either individual- 
      or cluster-randomisation. Inclusion criteria were menstruating women (or women aged 
      12 to 50 years) reporting on predefined primary (anaemia, haemoglobin concentration, 
      iron deficiency, iron-deficiency anaemia, all-cause mortality, adverse effects, and 
      cognitive function) or secondary (iron status measured by iron indices, physical 
      exercise performance, psychological health, adherence, anthropometric measures, 
      serum/plasma zinc levels, vitamin A status, and red cell folate) outcomes. DATA 
      COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the standard methodological procedures of Cochrane. 
      MAIN RESULTS: The search strategy identified 31,767 records; after screening, 90 
      full-text reports were assessed for eligibility. We included 67 trials (from 76 
      reports), recruiting 8506 women; the number of women included in analyses varied 
      greatly between outcomes, with endpoint haemoglobin concentration being the outcome 
      with the largest number of participants analysed (6861 women). Only 10 studies were 
      considered at low overall risk of bias, with most studies presenting insufficient 
      details about trial quality.Women receiving iron were significantly less likely to 
      be anaemic at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (risk 
      ratio (RR) 0.39 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.25 to 0.60, 10 studies, 3273 women, 
      moderate quality evidence). Women receiving iron had a higher haemoglobin 
      concentration at the end of intervention compared to women receiving control (mean 
      difference (MD) 5.30, 95% CI 4.14 to 6.45, 51 studies, 6861 women, high quality 
      evidence). Women receiving iron had a reduced risk of iron deficiency compared to 
      women receiving control (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.76, 7 studies, 1088 women, 
      moderate quality evidence). Only one study (55 women) specifically reported 
      iron-deficiency anaemia and no studies reported mortality. Seven trials recruiting 
      901 women reported on 'any side effect' and did not identify an overall increased 
      prevalence of side effects from iron supplements (RR 2.14, 95% CI 0.94 to 4.86, low 
      quality evidence). Five studies recruiting 521 women identified an increased 
      prevalence of gastrointestinal side effects in women taking iron (RR 1.99, 95% CI 
      1.26 to 3.12, low quality evidence). Six studies recruiting 604 women identified an 
      increased prevalence of loose stools/diarrhoea (RR 2.13, 95% CI 1.10, 4.11, high 
      quality evidence); eight studies recruiting 1036 women identified an increased 
      prevalence of hard stools/constipation (RR 2.07, 95% CI 1.35 to 3.17, high quality 
      evidence). Seven studies recruiting 1190 women identified evidence of an increased 
      prevalence of abdominal pain among women randomised to iron (RR 1.55, 95% CI 0.99 to 
      2.41, low quality evidence). Eight studies recruiting 1214 women did not find any 
      evidence of an increased prevalence of nausea among women randomised to iron (RR 
      1.19, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.82). Evidence that iron supplementation improves cognitive 
      performance in women is uncertain, as studies could not be meta-analysed and 
      individual studies reported conflicting results. Iron supplementation improved 
      maximal and submaximal exercise performance, and appears to reduce symptomatic 
      fatigue. Although adherence could not be formally meta-analysed due to differences 
      in reporting, there was no evident difference in adherence between women randomised 
      to iron and control. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Daily iron supplementation effectively 
      reduces the prevalence of anaemia and iron deficiency, raises haemoglobin and iron 
      stores, improves exercise performance and reduces symptomatic fatigue. These 
      benefits come at the expense of increased gastrointestinal symptomatic side effects.

TI  - Body image in patients with somatoform disorder.
PG  - 346

LID - 346
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although body-related problems are common in patients with somatoform 
      disorder, research focusing on how patients with somatoform disorder perceive and 
      evaluate their body is scarce. The present study compared differences in body image 
      between patients with somatoform disorder and respondents from a general population 
      sample. It also examined differences within the somatoform disorder group between 
      men and women and between the diagnostic subgroups conversion disorder, pain 
      disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder. METHODS: Data were obtained from 
      657 patients (67.5% female) with somatoform disorder (DSM-IV-TR 300.7, 300.11, 
      300.81, 300.82) and 761 participants (58.6% female) from the general population. The 
      Dresden Body Image Questionnaire (DBIQ) was used to assess body image in five 
      domains: body acceptance, vitality, physical contact, sexual fulfilment, and 
      self-aggrandizement. Confirmatory factor analysis and analyses of variance were 
      performed. Since differences in age and sex were found between the somatoform 
      disorder sample and the comparison sample, analyses were done with two samples of 
      560 patients with somatoform disorder and 351 individuals from the comparison sample 
      matched on proportion of men and women and age. RESULTS: Patients scored 
      significantly lower than the comparison sample on all DBIQ domains. Men scored 
      higher than women. Patients with conversion disorder scored significantly higher on 
      vitality and body acceptance than patients with undifferentiated somatoform disorder 
      and pain disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The mostly large differences in body image between 
      patients with somatoform disorder and the comparison sample as well as differences 
      between diagnostic subgroups underline that body image is an important feature in 
      patients with somatoform disorder. The results indicate the usefulness of assessing 
      body image and treating negative body image in patients with somatoform or somatic 
      symptom disorder.

TI  - Does Postoperative Cognitive Decline Result in New Disability After Surgery?
LID - 10.1097/SLA.0000000000003764 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Establish whether POCD is associated with new disability after surgery, 
      which would inform whether POCD impacts patient-centered outcomes. BACKGROUND: POCD 
      is a decline in neuropsychiatric tests scores from presurgical baseline which occurs 
      in approximately 15% of older patients 3 months after surgery. POCD is a research 
      construct meant to investigate patient and family reports of older adults who were 
      "never the same after surgery." However, many patients with POCD do not perceive 
      difficulty with thinking and memory, and the question remains whether POCD impacts 
      patient function. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 167 older 
      adults undergoing major noncardiac surgery (requiring at least a 2-day hospital 
      stay). Exclusion criteria were: history of dementia, cardiac or intracranial 
      procedure, inability to consent for themselves, or emergency surgery. We 
      administered formal neuropsychiatric testing (Alzheimer Disease Research Center UDS 
      battery), basic and instrumental activities of daily living (Alzheimer Disease 
      Research Center IADLs), pain (geriatric pain measure), and depression screening 
      (hospital depression and anxiety scale) before and 3 months after surgery. We 
      recorded all patient refined diagnostic related groups codes, blood pressure, 
      anesthetics and narcotics administered, surgical and anesthesia duration, and 
      measured complications and severity, length of stay, and readmissions. RESULTS: 
      Patients with POCD (21/167, 14.1%) had twice the proportion of new impairment in 
      IADL as compared to those without POCD (57% vs 27%, P = .01). The most common areas 
      of decline were social activities, ability to find items around the house, remember 
      appointments, shop and pay for items, do laundry, drive a car/use public transport, 
      and do housework. Predictors of IADL change after surgery included POCD, presurgical 
      cognition, presurgical function, postoperative depression, and the development of 
      postoperative complications. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with POCD experience a much 
      higher incidence of new disability after surgery. Baseline cognitive or functional 
      limitations are also risk factors for new disability. Many patients are not aware of 
      their limitations before surgery. Future study is needed to identify practical ways 
      to routinely screen patients and reduce risk. Patients need to be informed of their 
      risk for new disability after surgery to inform their medical decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surgery is an important part of the treatment modalities offered to older 
      patients with cancer. Natural ageing processes lead to deterioration of organ 
      function, making older patients more vulnerable and at risk for experiencing 
      less-favourable outcomes and complications after surgery. Non-pharmaceutical 
      interventions, such as music, may be preferable to medical interventions in older 
      people, who are at risk for adverse effects and drug interactions due to altered 
      physiology and drug metabolism. We aimed to assess the effect of music on 
      postoperative recovery in older patients and to determine the underpinning 
      theoretical models MATERIALS AND METHODS: This systematic review used the databases 
      PubMed, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), 
      PsychINFO, and Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale (RILM). Clinical 
      studies published, until 2015, investigating music as a single intervention for 
      hospitalised patients postoperative, population mean age 60 years or older were 
      selected. All types of postoperative music interventions, consisting of single or 
      more sessions, which take place at a hospital ward. All patient outcomes were 
      included. The search and screening was performed twice, independently, and seventeen 
      articles were finally selected. RESULTS: Four theoretical models were detected 
      underpinning the effect of music on postoperative recovery. The way the music 
      interventions were shaped, varied strongly. Therefore it remained unclear what is 
      the most effective way of performing the music in the postoperative period. Although 
      evidence is still limited, results do show that music has a positive effect on the 
      recovery of older patients after surgery. Pain and anxiety are reduced, and 
      relaxation, cognitive functioning, and patient satisfaction increase during 
      postoperative recovery. No negative side effects of music as an intervention were 
      found and therefore seems a non-harming and non-invasive intervention. CONCLUSION: 
      It seems worthwhile to further explore live music making in music interventions with 
      older hospitalised surgical patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between diet quality and intake of specific 
      foods with disability and symptom severity in people with multiple sclerosis (MS). 
      METHODS: In 2015, participants in the North American Research Committee on MS 
      (NARCOMS) Registry completed a dietary screener questionnaire that estimates intake 
      of fruits, vegetables and legumes, whole grains, added sugars, and red/processed 
      meats. We constructed an overall diet quality score for each individual based on 
      these food groups; higher scores denoted a healthier diet. We assessed the 
      association between diet quality and disability status as measured using 
      Patient-Determined Disease Steps (PDDS) and symptom severity using proportional odds 
      models, adjusting for age, sex, income, body mass index, smoking status, and disease 
      duration. We assessed whether a composite healthy lifestyle measure, a healthier 
      diet, healthy weight (body mass index <25), routine physical activity, and 
      abstinence from smoking was associated with symptom severity. RESULTS: Of the 7,639 
      (68%) responders, 6,989 reported physician-diagnosed MS and provided dietary 
      information. Participants with diet quality scores in the highest quintile had lower 
      levels of disability (PDDS; proportional odds ratio [OR] for Q5 vs Q1 0.80; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] 0.69-0.93) and lower depression scores (proportional OR for 
      Q5 vs Q1 0.82; 95% CI 0.70-0.97). Individuals reporting a composite healthy 
      lifestyle had lower odds of reporting severe fatigue (0.69; 95% CI 0.59-0.81), 
      depression (0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.66), pain (0.56; 95% CI 0.48-0.67), or cognitive 
      impairment (0.67; 95% CI 0.55-0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Our large cross-sectional survey 
      suggests a healthy diet and a composite healthy lifestyle are associated with lesser 
      disability and symptom burden in MS.

TI  - Pain and Psychological Outcomes Among Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans with Chronic 
      Pain and PTSD: ESCAPE Trial Longitudinal Results.
PG  - 1369-1376
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnaa007 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare pain and psychological outcomes in veterans with chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain and comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or pain 
      alone and to determine if veterans with comorbidity respond differently to a 
      stepped-care intervention than those with pain alone. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of 
      data from the Evaluation of Stepped Care for Chronic Pain (ESCAPE) trial. SETTING: 
      Six Veterans Health Affairs clinics. SUBJECTS: Iraq and Afghanistan veterans 
      (N = 222) with chronic musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: Longitudinal analysis of 
      veterans with chronic musculoskeletal pain and PTSD or pain alone and available 
      baseline and nine-month trial data. Participants randomized to either usual care or 
      a stepped-care intervention were analyzed. The pain-PTSD comorbidity group screened 
      positive for PTSD and had a PTSD Checklist-Civilian score ≥41 at baseline. RESULTS: 
      T tests demonstrated statistically significant differences and worse outcomes on 
      pain severity, pain cognitions, and psychological outcomes in veterans with comorbid 
      pain and PTSD compared with those with pain alone. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
      modeling change scores from baseline to nine months indicated no statistically 
      significant differences, controlling for PTSD, on pain severity, pain centrality, or 
      pain self-efficacy. Significant differences emerged for pain catastrophizing 
      (t = 3.10, P < 0.01), depression (t = 3.39, P < 0.001), and anxiety (t = 3.80, P < 
      0.001). The interaction between PTSD and the stepped-care intervention was not 
      significant. CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with the pain-PTSD comorbidity demonstrated worse 
      pain and psychological outcomes than those with chronic pain alone. These findings 
      indicate a more intense chronic pain experience for veterans when PTSD co-occurs 
      with pain. PTSD did not lead to a differential response to a stepped-care 
      intervention.

TI  - Concussion in Combination With Whiplash-Associated Disorder May Be Missed in Primary 
      Care: Key Recommendations for Assessment and Management.
PG  - 819-828
LID - 10.2519/jospt.2019.8946 [doi]
AB  - Whiplash and concussion may have similar presenting symptoms, biomechanical 
      mechanisms, and neurophysiological sequelae, but neither enjoys a gold standard 
      diagnostic test. Guidelines for whiplash and concussion are developed and 
      implemented separately. This disparate process may contribute to misdiagnosis, delay 
      appropriate primary care management, and impair patient outcomes. In our clinical 
      commentary, we present 3 cases where signs and symptoms consistent with whiplash 
      were identified in primary care. Symptoms in all cases included neck pain, headache, 
      dizziness, and concentration deficits, raising suspicion of coexisting 
      postconcussion syndrome. All cases were referred for specialist physical therapy. 
      Characteristics consistent with poor recovery in both whiplash and postconcussion 
      syndrome were confirmed, and multidisciplinary management, drawing from both 
      whiplash and concussion guidelines, was implemented. All patients reported 
      improvement in activities of daily living after tailored management addressing both 
      neck and head injury-related factors, suggesting that these conditions were not 
      mutually exclusive. Self-reported outcomes included reductions in neck disability 
      and postconcussion symptoms of between 20% and 40%. It may be appropriate for 
      whiplash and concussion guidelines to be amalgamated, enhanced, and mutually 
      recognized on a patient-by-patient basis. Primary health care professionals might 
      consider minimum screening to identify postconcussion syndrome in patients following 
      motor vehicle collision by administering questionnaires and assessing cranial nerve 
      function, balance, and cognition. Management should then incorporate principles from 
      both whiplash and concussion guidelines and harmonize with available imaging 
      guidelines for suspected spine and head trauma. J Orthop Sports Phys Ther

TI  - Tai Chi for older adults with chronic multisite pain: a randomized controlled pilot 
      study.
PG  - 1335-1343
LID - 10.1007/s40520-018-0922-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain is associated with poorer cognition and mobility, and fall 
      risk in older adults. AIMS: To investigate the feasibility of a randomized 
      controlled trial of mind-body exercise (Tai Chi) versus light physical exercise in 
      older adults with multisite pain. METHODS: Adults aged ≥ 65 years with multisite 
      pain who reported falling in the past year or current use of an assistive device 
      were recruited from Boston area communities. Participants were randomized to either 
      a Tai Chi or a light physical exercise program, offered twice weekly for 12 weeks. 
      The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes included 
      pain characteristics, cognition, physical function, gait mobility, fear of falling, 
      and fall rate. RESULTS: Of 176 adults screened, 85 were eligible, and 54 consented 
      and enrolled (average age 75 ± 8 years; 96.30% white; 75.93% female). The dropout 
      rate was 18% for Tai Chi and 12% for light physical exercise. For those completing 
      the study, exercise class attendance rate was 76% for Tai Chi and 82% for light 
      physical exercise. There were no significant group differences in most secondary 
      outcomes. Tai Chi significantly lowered pain severity (4.58 ± 1.73 to 3.73 ± 1.79, 
      p < 0.01) and pain interference (4.20 ± 2.53 to 3.16 ± 2.28, p < 0.05), reduced fear 
      of falling (90.82 ± 9.59 to 96.84 ± 10.67, p < 0.05), and improved several 
      single-task and dual-task gait variables, while light physical exercise did not 
      change these measures. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the 
      feasibility and acceptability of conducting a larger randomized controlled trial in 
      older adults with multisite pain. Study findings and challenges encountered will 
      inform future research.

TI  - The effectiveness of a simplified core stabilization program (TRICCS-Trivandrum 
      Community-based Core Stabilisation) for community-based intervention in chronic 
      non-specific low back pain.
PG  - 86

LID - 86
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a common public health problem all over the 
      world. Conservative therapy is prescribed as the initial treatment strategy in 
      chronic low back pain. The cornerstone of conservatism in back care is core muscle 
      strengthening. However, exercises prescribed for the purpose are manifold and some 
      are not easily done by patients in Asian countries. We developed an easy to adhere 
      exercise protocol for core stabilization and tested its effectiveness in south 
      Indian population. METHODS: Prospective study of 73 patients with chronic low back 
      pain (CLBP) who were subjected to Trivandrum Community-based Core Stabilisation 
      protocol of treatment. The enrolled patients underwent initial Oswestry Disability 
      Index (ODI) evaluation and Keele Start Back (KSB) questionnaire before starting the 
      protocol. Back education was given, and the patient started on stratified exercise 
      protocol. ODI assessment was done weekly. The trend in ODI changes and the factors 
      determining them were assessed using ANOVA. The correlation of quantitative 
      variables like age, initial ODI score, and KSB score with the rate of reduction of 
      ODI was assessed using Pearson's correlation. Cross-tabulations were done using the 
      chi-square test. Parametric tests were used throughout the analysis as the 
      quantitative study variables found to be linear. Multiple linear regression (for the 
      quantitative outcome) and binary logistic regression (for the dichotomous outcome) 
      were performed. RESULTS: Mean (SD) of ODI score has reduced significantly from 43.4 
      (16.6) to 24.6 (17.1) over the period of 6 weeks (p value < 0.001). The trend in 
      reduction of ODI scores was significantly more in KSB score less than or equal to 3 
      compared to KSB more than 3 even after adjusting for the general trend of decreasing 
      ODI score over time. The reduction in ODI scores appeared to be low for advancing 
      age (p = 0.468) and higher KSB scores (p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The TRICCS protocol 
      is effective in a community-based approach in achieving satisfactory outcomes in 
      CLBP in a period of 6 weeks. Patients with high KSB scores may require cognitive 
      intervention also.

TI  - Relationship Between Fear of Falling, Fear-Related Activity Restriction, Frailty, 
      and Sarcopenia.
PG  - 2602-2608
LID - 10.1111/jgs.16719 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of fear of falling (FOF) and fear-related 
      activity restriction (FAR) and their association with frailty, sarcopenia, gait 
      speed and grip strength, cognitive impairment, depression, social isolation, 
      self-perceived health, and vision. DESIGN: Observational cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING: Community. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 493 community-dwelling older adults, 
      60 years and older. MEASURES: FOF and FAR were assessed using validated single 
      closed-ended questions. Questionnaire was administered to evaluate frailty (FRAIL 
      scale - Fatigue, Resistance, Aerobic, Illness, and Loss of Weight), sarcopenia 
      (SARC-F - lifting and carrying 10 pounds, walking across a room, transferring from 
      bed/chair, climbing a flight of 10 stairs, and frequency of falls in the past 1 
      year), social isolation (six-item Lubben Social Network Scale), depression (Even 
      Briefer Assessment Scale), cognition (Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination), and 
      perceived general health and pain (The EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D)and EQ visual 
      analogue scale (EQ VAS)) . Binary logistic regression was performed to determine the 
      influence of sociodemographic, medical, functional, and cognitive variables on FOF 
      with/without FAR. RESULTS: Prevalence of FOF was 69.2%, and among them, 38.4% had 
      FAR. Prevalence of FOF with or without FAR in those with sarcopenia was 93.3% and in 
      prefrail/frail was 76.6%. FOF was significantly associated with prefrail/frail (odds 
      ratio (OR) = 2.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.26-3.73), depression (OR = 4.90; 
      95% CI = 1.06-22.67), number of medications (OR = 1.28; 95% CI = 1.03-1.59), and 
      female sex (OR = 3.54; 95% CI = 1.82-6.90). FOF + FAR was associated with depression 
      (OR = 5.17; 95% CI = 1.84-14.54) and sarcopenia (OR = 8.13; 95% CI = 1.52-43.41). 
      CONCLUSION: FOF with/without FAR is highly prevalent among community-dwelling older 
      adults, especially in those with sarcopenia, prefrailty, and frailty, with 
      significant negative impact on function, quality of life, social network, and mental 
      health. Further research is needed to investigate the value of population-level 
      screening, causal relationship, and efficacy of comprehensive intervention 
      strategies.

TI  - Clinician and Patient-reported Outcomes Are Associated With Psychological Factors in 
      Patients With Chronic Shoulder Pain.
PG  - 2030-9
LID - 10.1007/s11999-016-4894-0 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Validated clinician outcome scores are considered less associated with 
      psychosocial factors than patient-reported outcome measurements (PROMs). This belief 
      may lead to misconceptions if both instruments are related to similar factors. 
      QUESTIONS: We asked: In patients with chronic shoulder pain, what biopsychosocial 
      factors are associated (1) with PROMs, and (2) with clinician-rated outcome 
      measurements? METHODS: All new patients between the ages of 18 and 65 with chronic 
      shoulder pain from a unilateral shoulder injury admitted to a Swiss rehabilitation 
      teaching hospital between May 2012 and January 2015 were screened for potential 
      contributing biopsychosocial factors. During the study period, 314 patients were 
      screened, and after applying prespecified criteria, 158 patients were evaluated. The 
      median symptom duration was 9 months (interquartile range, 5.5-15 months), and 72% 
      of the patients (114 patients) had rotator cuff tears, most of which were work 
      injuries (59%, 93 patients) and were followed for a mean of 31.6 days (SD, 7.5 
      days). Exclusion criteria were concomitant injuries in another location, major or 
      minor upper limb neuropathy, and inability to understand the validated available 
      versions of PROMs. The PROMs were the DASH, the Brief Pain Inventory, and the 
      Patient Global Impression of Change, before and after treatment (physiotherapy, 
      cognitive therapy and vocational training). The Constant-Murley score was used as a 
      clinician-rated outcome measurement. Statistical models were used to estimate 
      associations between biopsychosocial factors and outcomes. RESULTS: Greater 
      disability on the DASH was associated with psychological factors (Hospital Anxiety 
      and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale combined coefficient, 0.64; 95% CI, 
      0.25-1.03; p = 0.002) and social factors (language, professional qualification 
      combined coefficient, -6.15; 95% CI, -11.09 to -1.22; p = 0.015). Greater pain on 
      the Brief Pain Inventory was associated with psychological factors (Hospital Anxiety 
      and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing Scale combined coefficient, 0.076; 95% 
      CI, 0.021-0.13; p = 0.006). Poorer impression of change was associated with 
      psychological factors (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Pain Catastrophizing 
      Scale, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia coefficient, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.87-0.99; p = 0.026) 
      and social factors (education, language, and professional qualification coefficient, 
      6.67; 95% CI, 2.77-16.10; p < 0.001). Worse clinician-rated outcome was associated 
      only with psychological factors (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (depression 
      only), Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia combined 
      coefficient, -0.35; 95% CI, -0.58 to -0.12; p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Depressive 
      symptoms and catastrophizing appear to be key factors influencing PROMs and 
      clinician-rated outcomes. This study suggests revisiting the Constant-Murley score.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In patients with cognitive impairments who are unable to self-report 
      pain, nurses must rely on behavioral observation tools to assess and manage pain. 
      Although frequently employed in medical-surgical units, evidence supporting the 
      psychometric efficacy of the Pain in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) for pain screening 
      in older adults with delirium is lacking. AIM: To examine the psychometrics of the 
      PAINAD for older adults with delirium in medical-surgical settings. DESIGN: A 
      descriptive repeated measures design. SETTING: Medical-surgical units in an urban 
      tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-eight older adults with delirium. 
      METHODS: Patients with delirium unable to self-report pain were screened by two data 
      collectors with the PAINAD and the Critical Care Pain Observation Tool (CPOT). 
      Patients with a PAINAD score ≥3 or a CPOT score ≥2 received a pain intervention. 
      Pain assessments were repeated 30 minutes post baseline or pain intervention. 
      RESULTS: Patients were predominately female (58.8%) with dementia (71%). Thirty-nine 
      patients screened positive for pain and received a pain intervention. PAINAD 
      reliability was strong (Cronbach's α = 0.81-0.87; interrater intraclass coefficients 
      [ICC] = 0.91-0.94; test-retest ICC = 0.76-0.77). Construct validity was supported by 
      a statistically significant interaction effect between time (baseline versus 
      follow-up) and condition (pain intervention versus no pain group; Rater 1: F(1,66) = 
      8.31, p = 0.005, η(p)(2) = 0.11; Rater 2: F(1,66) = 8.22, p = 0.006, η(p)(2) = 0.11. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The PAINAD is a reliable and valid tool for pain screening for older 
      adults with delirium in medical-surgical settings. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Pain and 
      delirium frequently co-occur in the older adult population. Best practices require a 
      holistic assessment for contributing pain and non-pain factors in patients 
      exhibiting distress.

TI  - Delirium Assessment Tools for Use in Critically Ill Adults: A Psychometric Analysis 
      and Systematic Review.
PG  - 38-49
LID - 10.4037/ccn2018633 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is highly prevalent in critically ill patients. Its detection 
      with valid tools is crucial. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the development and psychometric 
      properties of delirium assessment tools for critically ill adults. METHODS: 
      Databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Inclusion criteria were 
      English language, publication before January 2015, 30 or more patients, and patient 
      population of critically ill adults (>18 years old). Search terms were delirium, 
      scales, critically ill patients, adult, validity, and reliability. Thirty-six 
      manuscripts were identified, encompassing 5 delirium assessment tools (Confusion 
      Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit (CAM-ICU), Cognitive Test for 
      Delirium, Delirium Detection Score, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist 
      (ICDSC), and Nursing Delirium Screening Scale). Two independent reviewers analyzed 
      the psychometric properties of these tools by using a standardized scoring system 
      (range, 0-20) to assess the tool development process, reliability, validity, 
      feasibility, and implementation of each tool. RESULTS: Psychometric properties were 
      very good for the CAM-ICU (19.6) and the ICDSC (19.2), moderate for the Nursing 
      Delirium Screening Scale (13.6), low for the Delirium Detection Score (11.2), and 
      very low for the Cognitive Test for Delirium (8.2). CONCLUSIONS: The results 
      indicate that the CAM-ICU and the ICDSC are the most valid and reliable delirium 
      assessment tools for critically ill adults. Additional studies are needed to further 
      validate these tools in critically ill patients with neurological disorders and 
      those at various levels of sedation or consciousness.

PG  - 546

AB  - Introduction: Pain is an emotional experience. As a subjective feeling, it is 
      associated with pathophysiological processes occurring in the central nervous 
      system, which in turn may negatively affect the psychophysical function, cognitive 
      abilities, level of functioning and quality of life. The Aim: The aim of the study 
      was to assess orofacial and general pain location in patients with temporomandibular 
      joint disorder-myofascial pain with referral. Materials and Methods: The study group 
      consisted of 50 randomly selected, generally healthy people with complete natural 
      dentition (37 women and 13 men) at the age of 23.36 ± 2.14 years, referred to the 
      Department of Prosthodontics of the Medical University. All patients underwent 
      clinical examination according to the Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular 
      Disorders (Axes I and II). The subjects were classified as people with myofascial 
      pain with referral. The evaluation of severity of temporomandibular disorders was 
      based on the Temporomandibular Disorder Pain Screener and the Graded Chronic Pain 
      Scale. In order to assess orofacial and general pain location, a bodychart drawing 
      of pain was used. Results: The study group indicated 40 different areas of the body 
      affected by pain. 2-3 isolated pain locations were declared by a total of six 
      subjects. One person identified 17 affected areas. Forty four people reported pain 
      in at least four regions of the body. 70% of patients suffered from pain within the 
      right masseter muscle. Pain of the left masseter muscle was noted in 68% of cases. 
      Cervical ailments were reported by 56% of people. Pain of the left temporomandibular 
      joint was observed in 68% of patients, and of the right one in 54%. Conclusion: The 
      patients with myofascial pain with referral suffer from general ailments in 
      different regions of the body. Only the frequency of pain in the right masseter 
      muscle and right temporomandibular joint differed with respect to gender. The 
      suggestion that the prevalence of pain in other areas of the body varies between men 
      and women has not been confirmed. Due to a small sample size, such differences 
      cannot be excluded. Further studies in this area are needed.

TI  - Pain Severity and Anxiety Sensitivity Interplay Among Exclusive and Dual Electronic 
      Cigarette Users.
PG  - 211-219
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) are an increasingly common 
      form of substance use, there is little understanding of individual differences that 
      may relate to such use. The present investigation examined interactive effects 
      between the cognitive factor of anxiety sensitivity and pain severity in relation to 
      e-cigarette dependence, perceived risks of e-cigarette use, and perceived benefits 
      of e-cigarette use. METHOD: Participants were 319 e-cigarette users (60.5% female, 
      mean age = 36.82 years, SD = 10.62). RESULTS: As expected, the interaction between 
      anxiety sensitivity and pain severity was significantly related to increased 
      e-cigarette dependence, perceived risks of e-cigarette use, and perceived benefits 
      of e-cigarette use. The effects were evident above and beyond the variance accounted 
      for by sex, age, income, education, dual combustible cigarette use, and e-cigarette 
      use frequency. The form of the significant interaction indicated that participants 
      reporting co-occurring higher levels of anxiety sensitivity and pain severity 
      evinced greater e-cigarette dependence, perceived risks of e-cigarette use, and 
      perceived benefits of e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest 
      there needs to be further study of anxiety sensitivity and pain severity in the 
      context of e-cigarette use, as there may be benefit to screening for and clinically 
      addressing these factors to help offset e-cigarette use.

TI  - Impairment-driven cancer rehabilitation: an essential component of quality care and 
      survivorship.
PG  - 295-317
LID - 10.3322/caac.21186 [doi]
AB  - Adult cancer survivors suffer an extremely diverse and complex set of impairments, 
      affecting virtually every organ system. Both physical and psychological impairments 
      may contribute to a decreased health-related quality of life and should be 
      identified throughout the care continuum. Recent evidence suggests that more cancer 
      survivors have a reduced health-related quality of life as a result of physical 
      impairments than due to psychological ones. Research has also demonstrated that the 
      majority of cancer survivors will have significant impairments and that these often 
      go undetected and/or untreated, and consequently may result in disability. 
      Furthermore, physical disability is a leading cause of distress in this population. 
      The scientific literature has shown that rehabilitation improves pain, function, and 
      quality of life in cancer survivors. In fact, rehabilitation efforts can ameliorate 
      physical (including cognitive) impairments at every stage along the course of 
      treatment. This includes prehabilitation before cancer treatment commences and 
      multimodal interdisciplinary rehabilitation during and after acute cancer treatment. 
      Rehabilitation appears to be cost-effective and may reduce both direct and indirect 
      health care costs, thereby reducing the enormous financial burden of cancer. 
      Therefore, it is critical that survivors are screened for both psychological and 
      physical impairments and then referred appropriately to trained rehabilitation 
      health care professionals. This review suggests an impairment-driven cancer 
      rehabilitation model that includes screening and treating impairments all along the 
      care continuum in order to minimize disability and maximize quality of life.

TI  - Biofeedback for treatment of irritable bowel syndrome.
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012530.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012530
AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a prevalent condition that currently 
      lacks highly effective therapies for its management. Biofeedback has been proposed 
      as a therapy that may help individuals learn to exert conscious control over 
      sympatho-vagal balance as an indirect method of symptom management. OBJECTIVES: Our 
      primary objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of biofeedback-based 
      interventions for IBS in adults and children. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the 
      Cochrane Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Group Specialized Trials Register, 
      Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, the 
      Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and the Allied 
      and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED) from inception to 24 July 2019. We also 
      searched reference lists from published trials, trial registries, device 
      manufacturers, conference proceedings, theses, and dissertations. SELECTION 
      CRITERIA: We judged randomized controlled trials to be eligible for inclusion if 
      they met the Association for Applied Psychophysiology and Biofeedback definition of 
      biofeedback, and if they compared a biofeedback intervention to an active, sham, or 
      no-treatment control for the management of IBS. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two 
      authors independently screened trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed 
      risk of bias. Primary outcomes were IBS global or clinical improvement scores and 
      overall quality of life measures. Secondary outcome measures were adverse events, 
      assessments of stool frequency and consistency, changes in abdominal pain, 
      depression, and anxiety. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) 
      and 95% confidence interval (CI). For continuous outcomes, we calculated the mean 
      difference (MD) and 95% CI. We used GRADE criteria to assess the overall certainty 
      of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: We identified eight randomized trials with a total of 
      300 adult participants for our analysis. We did not identify any trials in children. 
      Four trials assessed thermal biofeedback. One trial assessed rectosigmoidal 
      biofeedback. Two trials assessed heart rate variability biofeedback. Two trials 
      assessed electrocutaneous biofeedback. Comparators were: no treatment (symptom 
      monitoring group; three studies), attention control (pseudomeditation; two studies), 
      relaxation control (one study), counseling (two studies), hypnotherapy (one study), 
      standard therapy (one study), and sham biofeedback (one study). We judged all trials 
      to have a high or unclear risk of bias. Global/Clinical improvement The clinical 
      benefit of biofeedback plus standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone was 
      uncertain (RR 4.20, 95% CI 1.40 to 12.58; 1 study, 20 participants; very 
      low-certainty evidence). The same study also compared biofeedback plus standard 
      therapy to sham biofeedback plus standard therapy. The clinical benefit in the 
      biofeedback group was uncertain (RR 2.33, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.80; 1 study, 20 
      participants; very low-certainty evidence). The clinical benefit of heart rate 
      biofeedback compared to hypnotherapy was uncertain when measured with the IBS 
      severity scoring system (IBS-SSS) (MD -58.80, 95% CI -109.11 to -8.49; 1 study, 61 
      participants; low-certainty evidence). Compared to counseling, the effect of heart 
      rate biofeedback was unclear when measured with a composite symptom reduction score 
      (MD 7.03, 95% CI -51.07 to 65.13; 1 study, 29 participants; low-certainty evidence) 
      and when evaluated for clinical response (50% improvement) (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.48 to 
      2.45; 1 study, 29 participants; low-certainty evidence). The clinical benefit of 
      thermal biofeedback used in a multi-component psychological intervention (MCPI) 
      compared to no treatment was uncertain when measured with a composite clinical 
      symptom reduction score (MD 30.34, 95% CI 8.47 to 52.21; 3 studies, 101 
      participants; very low-certainty evidence), and when evaluated as clinical response 
      (50% improvement) (RR 2.12, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.62; 3 studies, 101 participants; very 
      low-certainty evidence). Compared to attention control, the effects of thermal 
      biofeedback within an MCPI were unclear when measured with a composite clinical 
      symptom reduction score (MD 4.02, 95% CI -21.41 to 29.45; 2 studies, 80 
      participants; very low-certainty evidence) and when evaluated as clinical response 
      (50% improvement) (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.69, 2 studies, 80 participants; very 
      low-certainty evidence). Quality of life A single trial used overall quality of life 
      as an outcome measure, and reported that both the biofeedback and cognitive therapy 
      groups improved after treatment. The trial did not note any between-group 
      differences, and did not report any outcome data. Adverse events Only one of the 
      eight trials explicitly reported adverse events. This study reported no adverse 
      events in either the biofeedback or cognitive therapy groups (RD 0.00, 95% CI -0.12 
      to 0.12; 29 participants; low-certainty evidence). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is 
      currently not enough evidence to assess whether biofeedback interventions are 
      effective for controlling symptoms of IBS. Given the positive results reported in 
      small trials to date, biofeedback deserves further study in people with IBS. Future 
      research should include active control groups that use high provider-participant 
      interaction, in an attempt to balance non-specific effects of interventions between 
      groups, and report both commonly used outcome measures (e.g. IBS-SSS) and historical 
      outcome measures (e.g. the composite primary symptom reduction (CPSR) score) to 
      allow for meta-analysis with previous studies. Future studies should be explicit in 
      their reporting of adverse events.

TI  - Effect of Yoga versus Light Exercise to Improve Well-Being and Promote Healthy Aging 
      among Older Adults in Central India: A Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled 
      Trial.
LID - 10.3390/geriatrics4040064 [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aging is a natural process associated with many functional and 
      structural changes. These changes may include impaired self-regulation, changes in 
      tissues and organs. Aging also affects mood, physical status and social activity. 
      There are adverse changes in cognitive behavior, perceived sensation and thinking 
      processes. Regular physical activity can alleviate many health problems; yet, many 
      older adults are inactive. Yoga is one of the scientific and popular lifestyle 
      practice considered as the integration of mind, body and soul. Results of previous 
      studies reported positive effects of yoga on multiple health outcomes in elderly. 
      However, there is scarcity of scientific information where yoga's effect is examined 
      on over well-being and on multiple health outcomes simultaneously in elderly. This 
      protocol describes methods for a 12-week yoga-based intervention exploring the 
      effects of yoga on well-being in physically inactive elderly living in community. 
      Methods and analysis: This two group parallel single blind randomized controlled 
      trial that will be conducted at a designated facility of R.D. Gardi Medical College, 
      Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, Central India. A 12-week 60-min yoga intervention three 
      times weekly is designed. Comparison group participants will undergo a 60-min 
      program comprising light exercise focusing on conventional stretching to improve 
      mobility. After screening, 144 participants aged 60-80 years will be recruited. The 
      primary outcome is subjective well-being. Secondary outcomes include mobility, fall 
      risk, cognition, anxiety and depression, mood and stress, sleep quality, pain, 
      physical activity/sedentary behavior and cardio-metabolic risk factors. Assessments 
      will be conducted at baseline (0 week), after the intervention (12+1 week) and at 
      follow-up (36+1 week). Intention-to-treat analyses with mixed linear modeling will 
      be applied. DISCUSSION: Through this trial, we aim to determine whether elderly 
      people in the intervention group practicing yoga show more favorable primary 
      (well-being) and secondary outcomes than those in the light exercise focusing on 
      conventional stretching group. We assume that yoga may be practiced to maintain 
      health, reduce particular symptoms commonly associated with skeletal pain, assist in 
      pain relief and enhance well-being. We anticipate that practicing yoga will improve 
      well-being and mental health and may lead to significant improvement in depression, 
      pain and sleep quality.Ethics and dissemination: This study is approved by the 
      Institutional Ethics Committee of R.D. Gardi Medical College, Ujjain, IEC Ref No. 
      09/2018. All participants would be provided with written and verbal information 
      about the purpose of the project and would be free to withdraw from the study at any 
      time. Refusal to participate in the study would not have any negative consequences. 
      Confidentiality of the information of each participant would be ensured. Knowledge 
      obtained would be disseminated to stakeholders through workshops, meetings and 
      relevant scientific conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is prospectively 
      registered with the Indian Council of Medical Research Trial Registry 
      CTRI/2018/07/015051.

TI  - The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in mild cognitive impairment: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 195

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is 
      associated with a higher risk of cognitive impairment or dementia in the elderly, 
      leading to deleterious health effects and decreasing quality of life. This 
      systematic review aims to determine the prevalence of OSA in patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) and examine whether an association between OSA and MCI 
      exists. METHODS: We searched Medline, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, Cochrane 
      Database of Systematic Reviews, PsychINFO, Scopus, the Web of Science, 
      ClinicalTrials.gov and the International Clinical Trials Registry Platform for 
      published and unpublished studies. We included studies in adults with a diagnosis of 
      MCI that reported on the prevalence of OSA. Two independent reviewers performed the 
      abstract and full-text screening, data extraction and the study quality critical 
      appraisal. RESULTS: Five studies were included in the systematic review. Overall, 
      OSA prevalence rates in patients with MCI varied between 11 and 71% and were 
      influenced by OSA diagnostic methods and patient recruitment locations (community or 
      clinic based). Among studies using the following OSA diagnostic measures- 
      self-report, Home Sleep Apnea Testing, Berlin Questionnaire and polysomnography- the 
      OSA prevalence rates in MCI were 11, 27, 59 and 71%, respectively. In a 
      community-based sample, the prevalence of OSA in patients with and without MCI was 
      27 and 26%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Based on limited evidence, the prevalence of 
      OSA in patients with MCI is 27% and varies based upon OSA diagnostic methods and 
      patient recruitment locations. Our findings provide an important framework for 
      future studies to prospectively investigate the association between OSA and MCI 
      among larger community-based cohorts and implement a standardized approach to 
      diagnose OSA in memory clinics. PROSPERO REGISTRATION: CRD42018096577.

TI  - Meta-analytic evidence for decreased heart rate variability in chronic pain 
      implicating parasympathetic nervous system dysregulation.
PG  - 7-29
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000360 [doi]
AB  - Both sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems are involved in regulating pain 
      states. The activity of these systems seems to become disturbed in states of chronic 
      pain. This disruption in autonomic balance can be measured through the assessment of 
      heart rate variability (HRV), that is, the variability of the interval between 
      consecutive heart beats. However, there is yet to be a systematic evaluation of the 
      body of literature concerning HRV across several chronic pain conditions. Moreover, 
      modern meta-analytical techniques have never been used to validate and consolidate 
      the extent to which HRV may be decreased in chronic pain. Following the preferred 
      reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement 
      guidelines, this study systematically evaluated and critically appraised the 
      literature concerning HRV in people living with chronic pain. After screening 17,350 
      sources, 51 studies evaluating HRV in a chronic pain group met the inclusion 
      criteria. Twenty-six moderate-high quality studies were included in quantitative 
      meta-analyses. On average, the quality of studies was moderate. There were 6 
      frequency-domain and time-domain measures of HRV across a broad range of chronic 
      pain conditions. High heterogeneity aside, pooled results from the meta-analyses 
      reflected a consistent, moderate-to-large effect of decreased high-frequency HRV in 
      chronic pain, implicating a decrease in parasympathetic activation. These effects 
      were heavily influenced by fibromyalgia studies. Future research would benefit from 
      wider use of standardised definitions of measurement, and also investigating the 
      synergistic changes in pain state and HRV throughout the development and 
      implementation of mechanism-based treatments for chronic pain.

AB  - Delirium and postoperative neurocognitive disorder are the commonest perioperative 
      complications in patients more than 65 yr of age. However, data suggest that we 
      often fail to screen patients for preoperative cognitive impairment, to warn 
      patients and families of risk, and to take preventive measures to reduce the 
      incidence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. As part of the American Society 
      of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Perioperative Brain Health Initiative, an international 
      group of experts was invited to review published best practice statements and 
      guidelines. The expert group aimed to achieve consensus on a small number of 
      practical recommendations that could be implemented by anaesthetists and their 
      partners to reduce the incidence of perioperative neurocognitive disorders. Six 
      statements were selected based not only on the strength of the evidence, but also on 
      the potential for impact and the feasibility of widespread implementation. The 
      actions focus on education, cognitive and delirium screening, non-pharmacologic 
      interventions, pain control, and avoidance of antipsychotics. Strategies for 
      effective implementation are discussed. Anaesthetists should be key members of 
      multidisciplinary perioperative care teams to implement these recommendations.

TI  - Systematic Review: Pain and Emotional Functioning in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease.
PG  - 343-365
LID - 10.1007/s10880-019-09647-x [doi]
AB  - The objective of this systematic review was to assess the relationship between pain 
      (frequency/intensity/duration, impairment, coping) and emotional functioning in 
      pediatric Sickle Cell Disease, and evaluate the state of the literature. Studies 
      were included if they met each of the following criteria: (a) primarily pediatric 
      sample of youth or young adults up to age 21 years with SCD, (b) examined emotional 
      functioning including anxiety and/or depressive and/or internalizing symptoms, 
      and/or affect, (c) examined pain intensity/frequency/duration and/or pain-related 
      impairment and/or pain coping as it relates to emotional functioning, as defined 
      above. Using the established guidelines for systematic reviews, we searched 
      PsycINFO, PubMED, and CINAHL databases for studies published through June 2018. 
      Screening resulted in 33 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Study data were 
      extracted and evaluated for scientific merit, resulting in four studies being 
      removed. 29 studies were included in the final synthesis. Studies provide strongest 
      evidence of a relationship between increased pain frequency and higher depressive 
      and anxiety symptoms. There are moderate-to-strong associations between pain-related 
      impairment and depressive symptoms, and small-to-strong associations between 
      pain-related impairment and anxiety. When examining pain-coping strategies, 
      maladaptive cognitive strategies show the strongest association with emotional 
      functioning. There is a need for more adequately powered, prospective studies based 
      on theoretical frameworks in order to advance our understanding of the relationship 
      between pain and emotional functioning in pediatric SCD.

TI  - Late Diagnosis of Congenital Hypothyroidism in Young Adult.
PG  - 272-274
AB  - Congenital hypothyroidism is the most treatable cause of mental retardation. It is 
      also the most prevalent congenital endocrine disorder in childhood. A dramatic 
      improvement can be made by early detection, diagnosis, and adequate treatment of 
      levothyroxine in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. Severe cognitive 
      impairment is associated with persistent disease in patients who have delayed or no 
      treatment at all. In a modern era with complete healthcare facilities in a big city 
      like Jakarta, the prevalence late-diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism is supposed to 
      be very low. Since many districts have their own public healthcare facilities to 
      screen and diagnose congenital hypothyroidism in children at very young age, a 
      delayed diagnosis in adulthood is actually a rare case.In this medical illustration, 
      we report a case of 21 year-old woman who came to our hospital with abdominal pain. 
      She had mental retardation with no capability to communicate well with other person. 
      She had a short stature (her height was less than 1 meter). She also had mongoloid 
      face with big lips and a very big tongue. There was no goiter or lump on her neck. 
      Her motoric performance was very weak and frail. During abdominal examination, we 
      could see an umbilical bulging on her abdominal wall and on palpation, we could feel 
      an umbilical hernia. By abdominal ultrasound, we could see the umbilical hernia. 
      Unfortunately, no diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism had been made when she was 
      a newborn, there was also no past or known history of thyroid disease of her and her 
      family. She had a diagnosis of mental retardation with no specific etiology since 
      she was 5-years old. Based on the results of her laboratory examination, we had a 
      confirmed diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism with T4 10.56 nmol/L (normal 60-120 
      nmol/L) and TSH > 100 mIU/mL. We provided her treatment using levothyroxine based on 
      her body weight (25 mg daily). We arranged her to have abdominal CT Scan and 
      digestive surgery as further management for her umbilical herniation.Some defects 
      are correlated with congenital hypothyroidism when the disease is not treated 
      properly and adequately. Neurocognitive, neuromotoric, growth, and development are 
      some areas which can be disrupted by long-term hypothyroidism condition for patients 
      who had the disease since their early years of life. Congenital hypothyroidism 
      appears to be associated with an increased risk of congenital malformations. Several 
      congenital malformations associated with congenital hypothyrodism are umbilical 
      hernia, congenital heart disease, neurologic abnormalities, genitourinary 
      malformations, cleft palate, and Down's syndrome.Studies concluded that severity of 
      the congenital hypothyroidism has more important role than timing of treatment 
      initiation on long-term cognitive and motor outcomes. Detrimental effects on 
      developmental outcomes in congenital hypothyroidism patients may persist over time; 
      however, early treatment for patients at  very early ages may bring the best 
      cognitive outcomes and neuromotoric development.Regardless of the treatment options, 
      we can say that it is a loss case and a very late diagnosis and treatment of 
      congenital hypothyroidism. The unusual age of detection, delayed diagnosis and 
      treatment are some reminders for primary care physicians in our society to pay 
      greater attention to screening programs.6 Early detection and prompt treatment is an 
      essential part of measures to reduce burden of mental retardation in our society. 
      Delayed diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism case, which is diagnosed at 
      adulthood, indicates failure in screening program. Early diagnosis and treatment are 
      necessary to prevent long-term catastrophic effects. This a wake-up call of 
      attention and awareness for general public and primary care physicians in our 
      country.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this systematic review was to identify exercise parameters and 
      outcome measures used in cardiac rehabilitation programs following median 
      sternotomy, in the elderly cardiac population. DATA SOURCES: Five (5) electronic 
      databases were searched for relevant studies published in English after 1997. STUDY 
      SELECTION: The screening process was completed by two independent researchers, with 
      a third independent reviewer for overall agreement. Studies were selected if they 
      included only cardiac patients aged ≥65 years who had undergone valve surgery and/or 
      coronary artery bypass grafting via median sternotomy, and who had undertaken a 
      postoperative cardiac rehabilitation exercise intervention assessing physical 
      function and/or cognitive recovery as outcomes. DATA EXTRACTION: Two researchers 
      independently completed the data extraction and quality assessment. Quality was 
      assessed using a modified Downs and Black tool. DATA SYNTHESIS: In total, 11 
      articles were included for appraisal with respect to the quality of the study. Only 
      two randomised controlled trials were suitable for meta-analysis. A higher volume of 
      exercise was shown to have a positive effect on functional recovery, assessed using 
      the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) (mean difference=26.97m; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      6.96-46.97; p=0.008; I(2)=0%). No significant improvement was shown between 
      additional exercise compared to standard care in improving VO(2peak), maximal power 
      output or quality of life. No studies evaluated the effect of exercise on cognitive 
      recovery. CONCLUSIONS: Exercise significantly improves functional recovery in the 
      post-surgical elderly cardiac population, however uncertainty still exists with 
      regard to which modes of exercise and their specific parameters are most effective 
      in improving cognitive recovery.

AB  - Psychosocial and affective comorbidities are common in sickle cell disease (SCD) and 
      can strongly influence disease outcomes, especially those related to pain such as 
      frequency and intensity of pain, use of emergency- and hospital-based care and 
      opioid use. Depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, and substance use challenges are 
      among the common comorbidities that inform the patient experience of SCD. Underlying 
      neurocognitive changes may also contribute to the expression of affective disorders 
      in people with SCD. The neurobiological basis of these comorbidities in SCD is being 
      investigated. In this mini-review, we discuss psychosocial and affective disorders 
      that can coexist in children and adults with SCD and highlight how these common 
      psychological pathologies may interact with complications associated with SCD. 
      Patients with SCD should be screened for these comorbidities using standardized 
      screening tools and managed appropriately to improve outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the neuropsychological features of depressed patients 
      reporting high level of psychological pain. METHODS: Sixty-two inpatients were 
      included and divided into two groups according to the level of psychological pain 
      assessed by a Likert scale. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the Trail Making 
      Test, the Stroop test, and Verbal Fluency Test (semantic and phonemic verbal 
      fluency). Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine 
      neuropsychological factors associated with a high level of psychological pain. 
      RESULTS: The median level of psychological pain was 8/10. High level of 
      psychological pain was associated with poor phonemic verbal fluency performance in 
      men (p = 0.009), but not in women, even after controlling for confounding factors 
      (age, level of depression, anxiety). Groups did not differ on the Trail Making Test, 
      the Stroop test, or the semantic verbal fluency measure. CONCLUSION: Psychological 
      pain is a specific clinical entity that should be considered to be more significant 
      than just a symptom of depression. High level of psychological pain appears to be 
      associated with a deficit of phonemic verbal fluency in depressed men. This finding 
      could help to target psychotherapeutic treatments and improve screening.Key 
      pointsPatients with high psychological pain do not differ on the Trail Making Test, 
      the Stroop Test or the Sematic Verbal Fluency Measure to patients with low 
      psychological painHigh psychological pain is associated with a deficit in phonemic 
      verbal fluency in depressed menFuture research should aim to clarify gender 
      differences in psychological pain in participants with and without major depressive 
      disorder, as well as explore the complex relationship between cognition and the 
      different forms of pain (psychological, physical and psychosomatic).

TI  - Psychosocial factors associated with pain and sexual function in women with 
      Vulvodynia: A systematic review.
PG  - 39-50
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1668 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vulvodynia is a prevalent chronic vulval pain condition 
      affecting 10%-28% of women, and significantly impacting their health and quality of 
      life. It is currently poorly understood and biomedical treatments achieve only 
      modest benefits for pain and sexual functioning. A wider psychosocial 
      conceptualization of this condition may improve outcomes. There is currently no 
      coherent understanding of how psychosocial factors may contribute to outcomes in 
      Vulvodynia. The aim of this review is to identify and systematically review 
      psychosocial factors associated with pain and sexual outcomes and to inform a 
      psychosocial model of Vulvodynia. DATABASES AND DATA TREATMENT: 
      Observational/experimental studies reporting on the association between psychosocial 
      factors and pain/sexual outcomes in adult women with Vulvodynia were eligible. Two 
      reviewers independently conducted eligibility screening, data extraction and quality 
      assessment. Twenty-one studies were included, all focused on women with Provoked 
      Vestibulodynia (PVD). Most of the studies were low-to-medium quality. 
      RESULTS/CONCLUSION: A range of general/pain-related distress and avoidance 
      processes, and sex/intimacy avoidance or engagement processes were significantly 
      associated with pain, sexual functioning or sexual distress and sexual satisfaction, 
      supporting the role of a psychosocial approach to PVD. Depression, anxiety, 
      catastrophizing, pain-anxiety, pain acceptance, body-exposure anxiety, attention to 
      sexual cues, partner hostility and solicitousness, self-efficacy and penetration 
      cognitions are highlighted as potentially important treatment targets in PVD. Due to 
      the limited data available, developing a psychosocial model was not possible. 
      Directions for future research include examining the replicability and 
      generalizability of the factors identified, exploring differences/similarities 
      across Vulvodynia subsets and testing tailored theoretically based treatments. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The systematic review highlights the role of psychosocial factors 
      associated with pain and sexual functioning in Vulvodynia. The review findings 
      reveal that Vulvodynia presents both similar and unique cognitive, behavioural and 
      interpersonal features compared to other chronic pain conditions. There may be 
      important roles for negative sexual cues, body image-related factors during 
      intercourse, partner factors, self-efficacy beliefs and penetration cognitions, in 
      relation to pain and sexual functioning.

      Sclerosis: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 547069
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2020.547069 [doi]
LID - 547069
AB  - Background: Neuropathic and nociceptive pain frequently affect patients with 
      multiple sclerosis (MS), with a prevalence close to 90% and significant impact on 
      general health and quality of life. Pharmacological strategies are widely used to 
      treat pain in MS, but their effectiveness and side-effects are controversial. Among 
      non-pharmacological treatments for pain, non-invasive brain and spinal stimulation 
      (NIBSS) has shown promising preliminary results in MS. Objective: Systematic review 
      to investigate the effect of NIBSS for the management of pain in MS. Methods: A 
      literature search using Pubmed, Science Direct and Web of Science was conducted from 
      databases inception to February 21, 2020 for studies assessing the analgesic effect 
      of NIBSS on pain in MS. Results: A total of 279 records were title- and 
      abstract-screened, nine were assessed for full text and included. The NIBSS 
      techniques explored were transcranial direct current stimulation (N = 5), 
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (N = 2), transcranial random noise stimulation (N 
      =1), transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (N = 1). The targets were the 
      primary motor cortex (M1; N = 4), the left dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex (DLPFC; N 
      = 3), the spinal cord (N = 1), unspecified brain target (N = 1). The study designs 
      were randomized (N = 7), open label (N = 1), single case report (N = 1). Despite the 
      differences in study design, target and NIBSS technique that impeded a 
      meta-analysis, all the studies converge in showing a significant improvement of pain 
      after active NIBSS with less consistent effects on other symptoms of the 
      pain-related cluster (depression, fatigue, cognition) and quality of life. 
      Conclusions: Excitatory NIBSS over M1, left DLPFC and spinal cord appear to be the 
      most effective protocols for pain in MS. Open questions include the use of 
      neurophysiological or neuroimaging surrogate outcome measures, the stratification of 
      patients according to the clinical profiles and underlying pathogenetic mechanisms 
      and the combination of NIBSS to pharmacological treatment, neurorehabilitation, or 
      psychotherapy to improve the clinical effect. The duration of the effect to NIBSS 
      and the feasibility and efficacy of telemedicine NIBSS protocols are other open key 
      questions.

TI  - Topical Review: Pain in Survivors of Pediatric Cancer: Applying a Prevention 
      Framework.
PG  - 237-242
LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsx114 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To apply a biopsychosocial framework to understand factors influencing 
      pain in survivors of pediatric cancer to inform pain prevention efforts and 
      highlight the need for interdisciplinary care. METHOD: This topical review draws 
      from both pediatric cancer survivorship research and chronic noncancer pain research 
      to illustrate how components of a preventative model can be applied to pain in 
      survivorship. RESULTS: Pain is a common experience among long-term survivors of 
      pediatric cancer. The pain experience in survivorship can be conceptualized in terms 
      of biological disease and treatment factors, cognitive and affective factors, and 
      social and contextual factors. We review literature pertinent to each of these 
      biopsychosocial factors and tailor an existing public health prevention framework 
      for pain in survivors of pediatric cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Classifying survivors of 
      pediatric cancer into pain risk categories based on their daily experiences of pain, 
      pain-related functional impairment, and distress could help guide the implementation 
      of pain-related prevention and intervention strategies in this population. Future 
      research is needed to establish the efficacy of screening measures to identify 
      patients in need of psychosocial pain and pain-related fear management services, and 
      interdisciplinary pediatric chronic pain management programs in survivors of 
      pediatric cancer.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A systematic review of the literature on the risks of developing 
      iatrogenic opioid use disorders in chronic pain patients with psychiatric 
      comorbidity. METHODS: We conducted literature searches on Pubmed with key subjects: 
      "chronic pain", "psychiatry", "opioids" and "opioid use disorder" and for original, 
      English written articles published from 2000 until the first of September 2017. 
      Final selection of the articles for review was made in a consensus between three 
      reviewers. RESULTS: Longitudinal studies showed a significant association between 
      psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety disorders and the 
      development of problematic opioid use, more severe opioid craving and poor opioid 
      treatment outcome (analgesia and side effects) in chronic pain patients. 
      Cross-sectional studies showed a similar association between psychiatric disorders 
      and problematic opioid use, where studies in specialized pain settings showed a 
      higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, compared to non-specialized settings. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review showed a significant association between 
      psychiatric comorbidity, especially depression and anxiety disorders and the 
      development of problematic opioid use in chronic pain patients. We therefore 
      recommend psychiatric screening in chronic pain management. Chronic pain patients 
      with comorbid psychiatric disorders need a multidisciplinary approach and monitoring 
      opioid use is warranted in these patients.

PG  - 1665-1674
LID - 10.1017/S1041610219000024 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) measures three aspects of 
      catastrophic cognitions about pain-rumination, magnification, and helplessness. To 
      facilitate assessment and clinical application, we aimed to (a) develop a short 
      version on the basis of its factorial structure and the items' correlations with key 
      pain-related outcomes, and (b) identify the threshold on the short form indicative 
      of risk for depression. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. SETTING: Social centers for 
      older people. PARTICIPANTS: 664 Chinese older adults with chronic pain. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Besides the PCS, pain intensity, pain disability, and depressive 
      symptoms were assessed. RESULTS: For the full scale, confirmatory factor analysis 
      showed that the hypothesized 3-factor model fit the data moderately well. On the 
      basis of the factor loadings, two items were selected from each of the three 
      dimensions. An additional item significantly associated with pain disability and 
      depressive symptoms, over and above these six items, was identified through 
      regression analyses. A short-PCS composed of seven items was formed, which 
      correlated at r=0.97 with the full scale. Subsequently, receiver operating 
      characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted against clinically significant depressive 
      symptoms, defined as a score of ≥12 on a 10-item version of the Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale. This analysis showed a score of ≥7 to be the 
      optimal cutoff for the short-PCS, with sensitivity = 81.6% and specificity = 78.3% 
      when predicting clinically significant depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      short-PCS may be used in lieu of the full scale and as a brief screen to identify 
      individuals with serious catastrophizing.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Trait behavioral inhibition represents a tendency to react with 
      negative emotions - primarily worry - to cues which signal potential threats. This 
      tendency has been hypothesized by a two-factor model of chronic pain to have direct 
      effects on psychological and physical function in individuals with chronic pain, as 
      well as to influence the associations between pain-related maladaptive cognitions 
      and function. Our aim was to test these hypothesized associations in a sample of 
      individuals who were being screened for possible interdisciplinary chronic pain 
      treatment. METHODS: Eighty-eight patients referred to an interdisciplinary chronic 
      pain management program were administered measures of average pain intensity, trait 
      behavioral inhibition, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing, depressive symptoms, and 
      pain interference. We then performed two linear regression analyses to evaluate the 
      direct effects of trait behavioral inhibition on depressive symptoms and pain 
      interference and the extent to which behavioral inhibition moderated the 
      associations between kinesiophobia and pain catastrophizing, and the criterion 
      variables. RESULTS: In partial support of the study hypotheses, the results showed 
      significant (and independent) direct effects of trait behavioral inhibition on 
      depressive symptoms, and behavioral inhibition moderated the association between 
      kinesiophobia and depression, such that there were stronger associations between 
      kinesiophobia and depressive symptoms in those with higher dispositional sensitivity 
      to fear-inducing stimuli. However, neither direct nor moderating effects of 
      behavioral inhibition emerged in the prediction of pain interference. CONCLUSIONS: 
      If replicated in additional studies, the findings would indicate that chronic pain 
      treatments which target both reductions in maladaptive cognitions (to decrease the 
      direct negative effects of these on depressive symptoms) and the individual's 
      tendency to respond to pain with worry (as a way to buffer the potential effects of 
      maladaptive cognitions on depressive symptoms) might be more effective than 
      treatments that targeted only one of these factors. IMPLICATIONS: Additional 
      research is needed to further evaluate the direct and moderating effects of 
      pain-related behavioral inhibition on function, as well as the extent to which 
      treatments which target behavioral inhibition responses provide benefits to 
      individuals with chronic pain.

AB  - Up to 80% of nursing home residents are affected by pain. Pain assessment aims to 
      determine pain intensity, quality, and course of pain to underpin diagnostic 
      decision making. In the nursing home population, pain assessment is frequently 
      compromised by cognitive impairment. Characteristics of the nursing home setting, 
      such as resident's age, staff skill mix, and overall aims of the care provided, also 
      need to be taken into account. Therefore, an interdisciplinary evidence-based 
      clinical practice guideline for pain assessment in the nursing home setting was 
      developed. A systematic literature search was carried out covering publications 
      between 2003 and 2015. Thirty-nine studies were included in the preparation of this 
      guideline, supplemented by 12 international reference guidelines. Recommendations 
      were subjected to a structured consensus-finding process with representatives from 
      37 scientific and professional organizations and patient representatives. The 
      guideline underwent independent peer review before finalization. It comprises 62 
      recommendations that are grouped into 4 chapters: (1) context of pain assessment in 
      nursing home care; (2) screening; (3) focused assessment; and (4) 
      reassessment/monitoring of pain. Main recommendations stipulate that clinicians 
      should assess the patient's ability to provide self-report of pain when screening 
      for pain and that each resident should be screened for the presence of pain. A 
      focused assessment of pain, performed during rest and activities, should include 
      pain intensity, changed behaviors, general mobility, pain history, comorbidities, 
      and pain medication. Pain should be re-assessed at regular intervals using the same 
      instruments that were used for the focused assessment. Guideline development 
      demonstrated that many aspects of pain assessment in older persons have not received 
      adequate research attention so far. Available studies predominantly possess only low 
      levels of evidence. Therefore, research into this area needs to be systematically 
      developed to address questions of clinical relevance to support patient care.

AB  - Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a potentially debilitating aspect of Gulf War 
      Illness (GWI) that has received limited research attention. The purpose of the 
      present investigation was to determine symptom severity changes following exercise 
      in Veterans with GWI compared to control Veterans without GWI (CO). Sixty-seven 
      Veterans (n = 39 GWI; n = 28 CO) underwent a 30-minute submaximal exercise challenge 
      at 70% of heart rate reserve. Symptom measurements (e.g. fatigue, pain) occurred 
      pre-, immediately post-, and 24-hour post-exercise. Self-reported physical and 
      mental health, and physiological and perceptual responses to exercise were compared 
      between groups using descriptive statistics, independent samples t-tests and 
      repeated measures Analysis of Variance (RM-ANOVA). Post-exertional malaise was 
      modeled using Group by Time (2 × 3) doubly-multivariate, RM-MANOVAs for (1) mood, 
      (2) pain and (3) GWI-related symptoms, respectively (α = 0.05). Data were analyzed 
      for the full sample of Veterans with GWI (n = 39) compared to CO (n = 28) and a 
      subsample of Veterans (n = 18) who endorsed "feeling unwell after physical exercise 
      or exertion" ("PEM endorsers") during screening. Veterans with GWI reported 
      significantly lower physical and mental health. Groups exercised at similar relative 
      exercise intensities, but GWI perceived exercise as more painful and fatiguing. 
      Group-by-Time interactions were not significant for the entire sample for the three 
      PEM models, however limiting the GWI sample to "PEM endorsers" resulted in 
      significant interactions for Pain- and GWI-related PEM models. These results 
      indicate that not all GVs with GWI experience PEM 24 h after exercise, and that more 
      research is needed to determine the extent that exercise worsens symptoms in GWI.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Delirium is frequently observed in the postoperative and intensive 
      care unit (ICU) population. Due to the multifactorial origin of delirium and 
      according to international guidelines (e.g., American Geriatrics Society; Prevention 
      and Management of Pain, Agitation/Sedation, Delirium, Immobility, and Sleep 
      Disruption (PADIS) guideline), there are several but no incontestable options for 
      prevention and symptomatic treatment. The purpose of the Baden PRIDe (Prevention and 
      Reduction of Incidence of postoperative Delirium) trial was to determine whether 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction and delirium could be prevented by the 
      combination of possible preventive agents such as haloperidol and ketamine. In 
      addition, pre- and postoperative levels of the biomarkers cortisol, neuron specific 
      enolase (NSE) and S100β were measured to investigate their dynamics in delirious and 
      non-delirious patients after surgery. DESIGN: The Baden PRIDe Trial was an 
      investigator-initiated, phase IV, two-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled, 
      double-blind clinical trial. SETTING: Perioperative care. PATIENTS: 182 adult 
      patients that underwent elective or emergency surgery under general or combined 
      (i.e., general and regional) anaesthesia. INTERVENTIONS: Pre-anaesthetic, 
      pharmacologic prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction with haloperidol, 
      ketamine, and the combination of both vs. placebo. MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of 
      cognitive performance pre- and postoperatively with the MMSE, the DOS, the Nursing 
      Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) or the Intensive Care Delirium Screening 
      Checklist (ICDSC) during ICU stay. MAIN RESULTS: None of the three study arms - 
      haloperidol, ketamine, or both drugs combined - was significantly superior to 
      placebo for prevention of postoperative brain dysfunction and delirium (P = 0.39). 
      Measured levels of postoperative cortisol were significantly higher in delirious 
      patients. S-100β levels were significantly higher in all postoperative outcome 
      groups (cognitive impairment, delirium, no cognitive decline), whereas postoperative 
      NSE levels declined in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: The study results offer no 
      possibility for a novel recommendation for prevention of postoperative cognitive 
      decline including delirium. Perioperative S-100β trajectories in patients with 
      cognitive deterioration suggest affection of glial cells in particular. TRIAL

TI  - Cognitive, emotional, and behavioral profile in children and adolescents with 
      chronic pain associated with rheumatic diseases: A case-control study.
PG  - 433-445
LID - 10.1177/1359104518805800 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of chronic pain is about 30% in children and adolescents 
      which suffer from severe emotional distress. The aim of this observational study is 
      to investigate cognitive, emotional and behavioral consequences of benign chronic 
      pain in children and adolescents suffering of reumathologic diseases. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 49 participants, chronic pain participants (CPPs) and controls 
      (CGPs), affected by rheumatic diseases, were enrolled. Assessment included 
      collection of sociodemographic data, pain characteristics, and administration of 
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Depression Inventory for Children and Adolescents (CDI), 
      Conners' Parent Rating Scales-Revised (CPRS-R), Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), and 
      Screen for Child Anxiety-Related Disorders (SCARED). For the statistical analysis, 
      Student's t-test for independent samples and Pearson's correlation were used. The 
      significance value was set at p less than .05. RESULTS: A significant difference of 
      mean scores of CBCL items and of CPRS items between the two groups was found. In 
      CPPs, a significant correlation between VAS and mean scores of several CBCL items 
      and between VAS and mean scores of several CPRS items was found. CONCLUSION: Chronic 
      pain is a real syndrome in which an interdisciplinary treatment should be applied, 
      considering the psychopathological risk, especially in developmental age.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interstitial Cystitis/Bladder Pain Syndrome (IC/BPS) is a urologic 
      chronic pelvic pain syndrome with suboptimal treatment outcomes. Catastrophizing is 
      an empirically supported risk factor for greater IC/BPS pain. AIMS: In this study, a 
      moderated multiple mediation model is tested in which several additional 
      psychosocial risk factors (depression, illness and wellness-focused behavioral 
      coping strategies) are proposed as mediators or moderators in the existing 
      relationship between catastrophizing and IC/BPS pain. DESIGN: The present 
      questionnaire study employed a cross-sectional design. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS: 
      Female patients with an IC/BPS diagnosis (n = 341) were recruited at tertiary care 
      sites. METHODS: Participants completed questionnaires assessing pain, 
      catastrophizing, behavioral coping strategies, and depressive symptoms. Aggregate 
      factor scores were calculated following exploratory factor analyses. RESULTS: It was 
      found that patients with a greater tendency to catastrophize were more likely to 
      engage in illness-focused coping strategies, which contributed to the reporting of 
      greater sensory and affective pain. Furthermore, this mediating effect of 
      illness-focused coping on affective pain was more likely to occur in those patients 
      reporting greater depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Illness-focused behavioral 
      coping is an important mechanism between maladaptive pain cognition and aspects of 
      patient pain, with patients reporting greater depressive symptoms at increased risk 
      for elevated pain. Patient management techniques, including screening for 
      catastrophizing, coping, and depression, are recommended to enrich IC/BPS 
      management.

TI  - The Association of Post-traumatic and Postmigration Stress with Pain and Other 
      Somatic Symptoms: An Explorative Analysis in Traumatized Refugees and Asylum 
      Seekers.
PG  - 50-59
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnx005 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and somatic symptoms, such as pain, 
      are frequently seen in refugees. Their relationship is poorly understood, and the 
      treatment of these comorbid conditions can be very challenging. The current 
      cross-sectional study examined pain and other somatic symptoms and their 
      relationship with trauma history, PTSD symptom clusters, and current living 
      difficulties among treatment-seeking refugees. METHODS: One hundred thirty-four 
      treatment-seeking traumatized refugees (78% male, mean age = 42 years) were assessed 
      regarding lifetime traumatic experiences, symptoms of post-traumatic stress, overall 
      pain and somatic symptoms, and postmigration living difficulties. RESULTS: An 
      exploratory factor analysis of the 12 somatic symptoms revealed two distinct 
      factors: somatic symptoms related to bodily dysfunction ("weakness") and somatic 
      symptoms related to increased sympathetic activity ("arousal"). DSM-5 PTSD Criteria 
      D "alterations in cognitions and mood" and E "alterations in arousal and reactivity" 
      were primarily related to "weakness," while PTSD Criterion E "alterations in arousal 
      and reactivity" and postmigration living difficulties were associated with 
      "arousal." Overall pain was associated primarily with living difficulties and PTSD 
      Criterion D and Criterion E. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that somatic symptoms are 
      of considerable concern among traumatized refugees and that different patterns of 
      somatic symptoms are associated with different clusters of PTSD symptoms. The 
      findings contribute to the better understanding of the symptom presentation of 
      traumatized people who are experiencing somatization and potentially inform 
      treatment directions and highlight the importance of screening for PTSD in refugees 
      presenting with pain and somatic symptoms.

BTI - Evidence Map of Mindfulness
AB  - This evidence map provides an overview of “mindfulness” intervention research and 
      describes its volume and focus. It summarizes patient outcomes as reported in 
      systematic reviews of randomized controlled trial evidence. We searched 10 
      electronic databases to February 2014, screened reviews of reviews, and consulted 
      topic experts. We used a bubble plot as a visual overview of the distribution of 
      evidence and synthesized results narratively in an executive summary. In total, 81 
      systematic reviews met inclusion criteria and the largest review included 109 
      mindfulness RCTs. Most research is available for general overviews on health 
      benefits or psychological wellbeing. Reviews on chronic illness, depression, 
      substance use, somatization, distress, and mental illness included 10 or more RCTs. 
      Reviews suggest differential effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), 
      mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), and other mindfulness-based 
      interventions, and definitions of “mindfulness-based” varied. The most consistent 
      effect was reported for depression but published meta-analyses also indicated 
      effects compared to passive control of MBSR on overall health, chronic illness, and 
      psychological variables; MBCT for mental illness; and mindfulness interventions for 
      somatization disorders. Limited evidence is also available for mindfulness 
      interventions for pain, anxiety, and psychosis compared to passive control groups. 
      More detail is provided for priority areas post-traumatic stress disorder, stress, 
      depression, and wellness. The evidence map provides a broad overview (not detailed 
      or definitive effectiveness evidence) over the existing research to help interpret 
      the state of the evidence to inform policy and clinical decision making.

PG  - 113-120
LID - 10.17116/jnevro2020120071113 [doi]
AB  - The concept of chronic nonspecific back pain (CNBP) as a pathology of the spine 
      (osteochondrosis, spondylosis, intervertebral disc herniation, facet syndrome) is 
      extremely outdated and has not justified itself, first of all, from the therapeutic 
      view point. Numerous studies, including meta-analyzes and systematic reviews, have 
      convincingly shown the ineffectiveness of the methods of CNBP treatment, aimed only 
      at solving the problems of the spine itself and / or surrounding tissues. A 
      substantial amount of special imaging studies have proven the dissociation between 
      morphological vertebral changes and the clinical picture of pain. CNBP is the 
      overall result of the interaction of numerous factors in the spine tissues (changes 
      in the discs, joints, ligaments, fascia, muscles) and factors beyond the spine. The 
      latter include, first of all, psychological and social factors, cognitive functions, 
      the quality of night sleep, the level of physical activity, concomitant diseases 
      (comorbidity). In each patient, the interaction of these factors determines the 
      development of specific pathophysiological mechanisms of pain and, as a result, an 
      individual clinical picture of pain (phenotype). Understanding these processes will 
      allow for the reconsideration of the approach of searching for an anatomical pain 
      source as the main pathogenetic factor; recognizing the multifocal generation of 
      chronic pain as the result of a complex interaction of biological, psychological and 
      social factors; the development of new principles and therapy algorithms. The 
      authors propose to introduce into practice a multidomain screening approach for 
      evaluating patients with CNBP, which would take into account the phenotype of pain, 
      factors affecting its perception, and allow personalized treatment for each patient 
      based on the biopsychosocial approach.

TI  - Blood-brain barrier leakage in systemic lupus erythematosus is associated with gray 
      matter loss and cognitive impairment.
PG  - 1580-1587
LID - 10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-218004 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the association between blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, 
      brain volume and cognitive dysfunction in adult patients with systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE). METHODS: A total of 65 ambulatory patients with SLE and 9 
      healthy controls underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI scanning, for quantitative 
      assessment of BBB permeability. Volumetric data were extracted using the VolBrain 
      pipeline. Global cognitive function was evaluated using a screening battery 
      consisting of tasks falling into five broad cognitive domains, and was compared 
      between patients with normal versus extensive BBB leakage. RESULTS: Patients with 
      SLE had significantly higher levels of BBB leakage compared with controls (p=0.04). 
      Extensive BBB leakage (affecting over >9% of brain volume) was identified only in 
      patients with SLE (16/65; 24.6%), who also had smaller right and left cerebral grey 
      matter volumes compared with controls (p=0.04). Extensive BBB leakage was associated 
      with lower global cognitive scores (p=0.02), and with the presence of impairment on 
      one or more cognitive tasks (p=0.01). CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence for 
      a link between extensive BBB leakage and changes in both brain structure and 
      cognitive function in patients with SLE. Future studies should investigate the 
      mechanisms underlying BBB-mediated cognitive impairment, validate the diagnostic 
      utility of BBB imaging, and determine the potential of targeting the BBB as a 
      therapeutic strategy in patients with SLE.

AB  - Compelling evidence has shown chronic widespread and exaggerated pain experience in 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain (MSKP) conditions. In addition, neuroimaging research 
      has revealed morphological and functional brain alterations in these patients. It is 
      hypothesized that brain alterations play a role in the persistent pain complaints of 
      patients with chronic MSKP. Nevertheless, lack of overview exists regarding the 
      relations between brain alterations and clinical measures of pain. The present 
      systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, to investigate the relations 
      between structural or functional brain alterations, using magnetic resonance imaging 
      scans, and clinical pain measures in patients with chronic MSKP. PubMed, Web of 
      Science, Cinahl, and Cochrane databases were searched. First, the obtained articles 
      were screened according to title and abstract. Second, the screening was on the 
      basis of full-text. Risk of bias in included studies was investigated according to 
      the modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Twenty studies met the inclusion criteria. 
      Moderate evidence shows that higher pain intensity and pressure pain sensitivity are 
      related to decreased regional gray matter (GM) volume in brain regions encompassing 
      the cingulate cortex, the insula, and the superior frontal and temporal gyrus. 
      Further, some evidence exists that longer disease duration in fibromyalgia is 
      correlated with decreased total GM volume. Yet, inconclusive evidence exists 
      regarding the association of longer disease duration with decreased or increased 
      regional GM volume in other chronic MSKP conditions. Inconclusive evidence was found 
      regarding the direction of the relation of pain intensity and pressure pain 
      sensitivity with microstructural white matter and functional connectivity 
      alterations. In conclusion, preliminary to moderate evidence demonstrates relations 
      between clinical pain measures, and structural and functional connectivity 
      alterations within brain regions involved in somatosensory, affective, and cognitive 
      processing of pain in chronic MSKP. Nevertheless, inconclusive results exist 
      regarding the direction of these relations. Further research is warranted to unravel 
      whether these brain alterations are positively or negatively correlated to clinical 
      pain measures. PERSPECTIVE: Structural and functional brain alterations within 
      regions involved in somatosensory, affective, and cognitive pain processing play a 
      crucial role in the persistent pain of chronic MSKP patients. Accordingly, these 
      brain alterations have to be taken into account when assessing and treating patients 
      with chronic MSKP.

TI  - The sensory and affective components of pain: are they differentially modifiable 
      dimensions or inseparable aspects of a unitary experience? A systematic review.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is recognised to have both a sensory dimension (intensity) and an 
      affective dimension (unpleasantness). Pain feels like a single unpleasant bodily 
      experience, but investigations of human pain have long considered these two 
      dimensions of pain to be separable and differentially modifiable. The evidence 
      underpinning this separability and differential modifiability is seldom presented. 
      We aimed to fill this gap by evaluating the current evidence base for whether or not 
      the sensory and affective dimensions of pain can be selectively modulated using 
      cognitive manipulations. METHODS: A rigorous systematic search, based on a priori 
      search terms and consultation with field experts, yielded 4270 articles. A detailed 
      screening process was based on the following recommendations: (i) evaluation of 
      effectiveness; (ii) examination of methodological rigour, including each study 
      having an a priori intention to cognitively modulate one of the two dimensions of 
      pain; and (iii) sound theoretical reasoning. These were used to ensure that included 
      studies definitively answered the research question. RESULTS: After in-depth 
      critique of all 12 articles that met the inclusion criteria, we found that there is 
      no compelling evidence that the sensory and affective dimensions of pain can be 
      selectively and intentionally modulated using cognitive manipulations in humans. 
      CONCLUSIONS: We offer potential explanations for this discrepancy between 
      assumptions and evidence and contend that this finding highlights several important 
      questions for the field, from both the research and clinical perspectives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between the 
      cognitive changes of normal aging and early dementia. Tai Chi (TC) may be 
      particularly beneficial to patients with MCI due to its whole-body coordination 
      characteristics. This systematic review protocol aims to outline the methods that 
      will be used to assess the comparative effectiveness and safety of TC for MCI 
      through a systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic review will 
      identify and evaluate randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that examined the effects 
      and safety of TC compared to a placebo, conventional treatment, and no treatment on 
      cognitive function in individuals with MCI. Studies from databases of MEDLINE, 
      PubMed, Embase, Global Health, Cochrane Library, and Scopus from January 1990 to 
      March 2019 reported in English will be searched. Two independent reviewers will 
      screen the studies for inclusion with the eligibility criteria and extract data. 
      Risk of bias of individual studies will be assessed in line with Cochrane risk of 
      bias tool. The overall quality of cumulative evidence will be assessed using 
      selected Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations 
      criteria. Statistics will be used for heterogeneity assessment, sensitivity 
      analysis, data synthesis, generating funnel plots, and subgroup analysis. 
      Meta-analysis will be performed, if sufficiently homogeneous studies are found. A 
      narrative synthesis will be conducted, grouping studies by exposure and outcome 
      definitions, and describing any differences by subgroups. RESULTS: This study will 
      provide practical and targeted evidence in investigating the impact of TC exercise 
      for individuals with MCI. CONCLUSION: The findings of our study will provide updated 
      evidence to determine whether TC is an effective intervention to patients with MCI.

TI  - The "Wholesome Contact" non-pharmacological, volunteer-delivered multidisciplinary 
      programme to prevent hospital delirium in elderly patients: study protocol for a 
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 439

LID - 439
AB  - BACKGROUND: In hospital settings, delirium affects as many as 50% of older patients, 
      aggravating their symptoms and worsening their condition, and therefore increasing 
      the risk of in-hospital complications and death. The aim of this study is to assess 
      the efficacy of structured, non-pharmacological care, delivered to older 
      hospitalised patients by trained volunteers (students of medical fields), on the 
      reduction of incidence of adverse health-related outcomes. METHODS/DESIGN: This 
      trial will be a randomised, investigator-blind, controlled trial conducted in an 
      internal medicine and geriatric ward in Poland. We aim to include 416 patients who 
      are 70 years of age and have been hospitalised for medical reasons. Eligible 
      patients will be randomised 1:1 to receive structured, non-pharmacological care 
      delivered by students of medicine, psychology and nursing, together with standard 
      medical treatment or standard medical care alone. The protocol of interventions has 
      been designed to cover nine main risk factors for delirium, with the scope of 
      multidisciplinary interventions being individualised and tailored. The protocol will 
      be aimed at immobilisation, vision and hearing impairment, cognitive impairment and 
      disorientation, stress and anxiety, sleep-wake cycle disturbances, dehydration and 
      malnutrition, and pain. A structured evaluation of patients' cognition, mood, 
      anxiety and functional performance is planned to be carried out twice, on the day of 
      group allocation and at discharge; structured screening assessment for delirium will 
      be conducted daily using the Confusion Assessment Method. The primary outcome will 
      be the incidence of delirium in hospital; secondary outcomes will be in-hospital 
      changes in cognition, mood and anxiety, and functional status, occurrence of falls 
      and death. DISCUSSION: Delirium prevention programmes are being introduced 
      worldwide. A particular novelty of our project, however, is that invitations for 
      voluntary work with older patients at risk for delirium will be addressed to medical 
      students. With the use of the service learning method, the students will shape their 
      attitudes, increase their knowledge and understanding of hospital care, and master 
      competencies to work within interdisciplinary teams, which establishes the 
      originality and practicality of the project. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Polish Science

AB  - Median age at bladder cancer (BC) diagnosis is older than for other major tumours. 
      Age should not determine treatment, and patients should be fully involved in 
      decisions. Patients should be screened with Mini-Cog™ for cognitive impairment and 
      the G8 to ascertain need for comprehensive geriatric assessment. In non-muscle 
      invasive disease, older adult patients should have standard therapy. Age does not 
      contraindicate intravesical therapy. Independent of age and fitness, patients with 
      muscle-invasive BC should have at least cross-sectional imaging. Data suggest 
      extensive undertreatment in older adult patients, leading to poor outcomes. Standard 
      treatment for a fit patient differs between countries. Radical cystectomy and 
      trimodality therapy are first-line options. Radical cystectomy patients should be 
      referred to an experienced centre and prehabilitation is mandatory. Older adult 
      patients should be considered for neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy, according to 
      guidelines. In urinary diversion, avoiding bowel surgery for reconstruction of the 
      lower urinary tract significantly reduces complications. If a patient is unfit for 
      or refuses standard treatment, RT alone, or TURBT in selected cases should be 
      considered. In metastatic BC, older adult patients should receive standard systemic 
      therapy, depending on fitness for cisplatin and prognosis. Efficacy and tolerability 
      of immunotherapy (IO) appears similar to younger patients. Second line IO is 
      standard in platinum pre-treated patients, with benefit and tolerability in the 
      older adult similar to younger patients. The toxicity profile seems to favour IO in 
      the older adult but more data are needed. Patients progressing on IO may respond to 
      further systemic treatment. In metastatic disease, palliative care should begin 
      early.

TI  - What Role Does Positive Psychology Play in Understanding Pain Intensity and

PG  - 1769-1776

AB  - BACKGROUND: A large body of research shows that psychologic distress and ineffective 
      coping strategies substantially contribute to more severe pain and increased 
      physical limitations among patients with orthopaedic disorders. However, little is 
      known about the relationship between positive psychology (constructs that enable 
      individuals to thrive and adapt to challenges) and pain and physical limitations in 
      this population. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: (1) Which positive-psychology factors 
      (satisfaction with life, gratitude, coping through humor, resilience, mindfulness, 
      and optimism) are independently associated with fewer upper-extremity physical 
      limitations after controlling for the other clinical and demographic variables? (2) 
      Which positive-psychology factors are independently associated with pain intensity 
      after controlling for relevant clinical and demographic variables? METHODS: In a 
      cross-sectional study, we recruited patients presenting for a scheduled appointment 
      with an orthopaedic surgeon at a hand and upper-extremity clinic of a major urban 
      academic medical center. Of 125 approached patients, 119 (44% men; mean age, 50 ± 17 
      years) met screening criteria and agreed to participate. Patients completed a 
      clinical and demographic questionnaire, the Numerical Rating Scale to assess pain 
      intensity, the Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      Upper Extremity Physical Function computerized adaptive test to assess physical 
      limitations, and six measures assessing positive-psychology constructs: The 
      Satisfaction with Life Scale, the Gratitude Questionnaire, the Coping Humor Scale, 
      the Brief Resilience Scale, the Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness Scale-Revised, 
      and the Life Orientation Test-Revised. We first examined bivariate associations 
      among physical limitations, pain intensity, and all positive-psychology factors as 
      well as demographic and clinical variables. All variables that demonstrated 
      associations with physical limitations or pain intensity at p < 0.05 were included 
      in two-stage multivariable hierarchical regression models. RESULTS: After 
      controlling for the potentially confounding effects of prior surgical treatment and 
      duration since pain onset (step1; R total = 0.306; F[7,103] = 6.50), the 
      positive-psychology variables together explained an additional 15% (R change = 
      0.145, F change [5, 103] = 4.297, p = 0.001) of the variance in physical 
      limitations. Among the positive-psychology variables tested, mindfulness was the 
      only one associated with fewer physical limitations (β = 0.228, t = 2.293, p = 
      0.024, 4% variance explained). No confounding demographic or clinical variables were 
      found for pain intensity in bivariate analyses. All positive-psychology variables 
      together explained 23% of the variance in pain intensity (R = 0.23; F[5,106] = 6.38, 
      p < 0.001). Among the positive-psychology variables, satisfaction with life was the 
      sole factor independently associated with higher intensity (β = -0.237, t = -2.16, p 
      = 0.033, 3% variance explained). CONCLUSIONS: Positive-psychology variables 
      explained 15% of the variance in physical limitations and for 23% of the variance in 
      pain intensity among patients with heterogenous upper extremity disorders within a 
      hand and upper extremity practice. Of all positive-psychology factors, mindfulness 
      and satisfaction with life were most important for physical limitations and pain 
      intensity, respectively. As positive-psychology factors are more easily modifiable 
      through skills-based interventions than pain and physical limitations, results 
      suggest implementation of such interventions to potentially improve outcomes in this 
      population. Skills-based interventions targeting mindfulness and satisfaction with 
      life may be of particular benefit. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, prognostic study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the specific effect of insomnia on neuropsychological 
      functioning in patients with very complex chronic pain. BACKGROUND: Individuals with 
      insomnia disorder or chronic pain often experience cognitive deficits, with both 
      conditions appearing to correlate with impairments in neuropsychological functions. 
      As insomnia often occurs comorbid with chronic pain, distinguishing the differential 
      effects of these two syndromes on an individual's neuropsychological functioning can 
      be challenging. Comorbid depressive symptoms in these individuals, which may also 
      affect cognitive function, may further obscure the associations between chronic 
      pain, insomnia, and the neuropsychological profile. METHODS: The neuropsychological 
      function of 22 individuals with very complex chronic pain was assessed using 
      specialized tests examining aspects of memory and executive functioning. The 
      severity of insomnia, depression, and anxiety was measured using questionnaires, and 
      pain levels were assessed using a visual analog scale. Pain medications were 
      transformed to the morphine-equivalent daily dose. RESULTS: Insomnia severity was 
      found to predict memory function, accounting for 32.4% of the variance: A 1 SD 
      increase in insomnia severity decreased memory function by 0.57 SD. The negative 
      correlation between insomnia and memory was significant even after controlling for 
      pain level, morphine-equivalent daily dose, and comorbid levels of anxiety and 
      depression. CONCLUSIONS: Insomnia severity independently predicted memory function 
      in patients with very complex chronic pain, even after controlling for other factors 
      known to impair cognitive function. Insomnia may possibly explain some of the 
      cognitive impairments related to chronic pain; thus, screening for, and treating, 
      sleep disturbances may be a central aspect of chronic pain rehabilitation.

      Single Center Experience.

LID - 271
AB  - Background: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a recognized pain condition the treatment 
      of which can be very challenging. Various surgical interventions can be applied in 
      cases of therapy-resistance to drug treatments. The central lateral thalamotomy 
      (CLT) against neurogenic (or neuropathic) pain is based on multiarchitectonic 
      histological as well as physiopathological studies, and integrates the nucleus in a 
      large thalamocortical (TC) and corticocortical network responsible for the sensory, 
      cognitive and affective/emotional components of pain. The advent of the magnetic 
      resonance imaging guided high intensity focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) brought a strong 
      reduction in morbidity and increase in accuracy compared to penetration techniques. 
      Objective: This study was aimed at analyzing the outcome of bilateral MRgFUS CLT for 
      chronic therapy-resistant trigeminal pain, all performed in one single center. 
      Methods: Patients were categorized in Classical, Idiopathic and Secondary TN. By 
      definition, paroxysms lasted for seconds up to 2 min. All patients were screened for 
      trigeminal neurovascular conflict. In case of classical TN, microvascular 
      decompression was proposed. Therapy-resistance and thus indication for MRgFUS CLT 
      was based on the lack of efficacy and/or side effects of antiepileptic and 
      antidepressant drugs. Good outcome was defined by a pain relief ≥50%. Results: Eight 
      patients suffering from chronic therapy-resistant trigeminal neuralgia were treated. 
      All suffered from pain with paroxysmal character. Six patients reported additionally 
      continuous pain. Mean follow-up was 53 months (range: 12-92, median: 60 months). The 
      mean pain relief assessed by patients was 51% (median: 58%, range: 0-90%) at 3 
      months, 71% (median: 65%, range: 40-100%) at 1 year and 78% (median: 75%, range: 
      50-100%) at their longest follow-up. This represents 63% good outcomes at 3 months, 
      88% at 1 year and 100% at last follow-up. Frequency of the mean pain paroxysms 
      decreased from 84 per day preoperative to 3.9 at 1 year postoperatively. There were 
      no serious adverse events in this series. Conclusion: Our study provides preliminary 
      support for the safety and efficacy of MRgFUS CLT, a histologically and 
      pathophysiologically based medial thalamotomy against chronic therapy-resistant 
      trigeminal neuralgia.

TI  - Trauma Exposure and Functional Movement Characteristics of Male Tactical Athletes.
PG  - 384-389
LID - 10.4085/1062-6050-111-19 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Tactical athletes commonly experience high levels of physical stress, which 
      may increase their risk of musculoskeletal injury. It is critical to understand 
      psychological predictors of functional movement (FM), which may help prevent 
      musculoskeletal injury in this population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the associations 
      of combat and trauma exposure with FM characteristics of male tactical athletes. 
      Secondary objectives were to explore confounding influences of age and physical 
      injury history as well as the mediating role of bodily pain. DESIGN: Cross-sectional 
      study. SETTING: Research laboratory. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-two 
      healthy, male, active-duty US Navy Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel (age = 34.0 
      ± 6.7 years). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Participants completed measures of combat 
      exposure, trauma exposure, physical injury history, and bodily pain. We assessed FM 
      characteristics (ie, Functional Movement Screen [FMS], Y-Balance Test), from which 
      we derived a composite functional status (CFS) measure. Hypotheses were tested using 
      correlational and multiple regression (causal-steps) models. RESULTS: In unadjusted 
      models, trauma exposure was inversely associated with the FMS (P = .005) and CFS (P 
      = .009) scores. In adjusted models, these relationships were robust to the 
      confounding influences of age and physical injury history. Trauma exposure and 
      bodily pain were substantive, independent predictors of FMS and CFS in causal-steps 
      models (all P values < .05), implying additive rather than mediated effects 
      (R(2)(adj) = 0.18-0.20). Combat exposure did not predict FM characteristics. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of the influence of trauma 
      exposure on the FM characteristics of male tactical athletes, independent of age, 
      physical injury, and bodily pain. This program of research may help to advance the 
      prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal injuries in the tactical environment.

TI  - Care of the Colorectal Cancer Survivor.
PG  - 331-336
AB  - Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the United States and has a 
      five-year survival rate of 65%. The American Cancer Society and other experts have 
      released guidelines on surveillance, health promotion, screening for other 
      malignancies, and management of treatment effects. Surveillance for disease 
      recurrence should occur every three to six months for the first two to three years, 
      then every six months for a total of five years. Each visit should include a history 
      and physical examination, routine care for chronic medical conditions, and screening 
      for other primary cancers according to guidelines for the general population. Topics 
      addressed depend on the treatment utilized but generally include gastrointestinal 
      issues, neuropathy, pain, urinary symptoms, fatigue, psychological issues, cognitive 
      problems, sexual symptoms, and stoma care. Carcinoembryonic antigen testing should 
      be performed at each visit in patients who are candidates for further intervention. 
      Chest, abdomen, and pelvic computed tomography should be performed annually for five 
      years after treatment. Colonoscopy should be repeated one year after treatment, then 
      three years later if no advanced adenoma is identified.

TI  - Poor Performance on a Preoperative Cognitive Screening Test Predicts Postoperative 
      Complications in Older Orthopedic Surgical Patients.
PG  - 765-774
LID - 10.1097/ALN.0000000000001859 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons and the American Geriatrics Society 
      have suggested that preoperative cognitive screening should be performed in older 
      surgical patients. We hypothesized that unrecognized cognitive impairment in 
      patients without a history of dementia is a risk factor for development of 
      postoperative complications. METHODS: We enrolled 211 patients 65 yr of age or older 
      without a diagnosis of dementia who were scheduled for an elective hip or knee 
      replacement. Patients were cognitively screened preoperatively using the Mini-Cog 
      and demographic, medical, functional, and emotional/social data were gathered using 
      standard instruments or review of the medical record. Outcomes included discharge to 
      place other than home (primary outcome), delirium, in-hospital medical 
      complications, hospital length-of-stay, 30-day emergency room visits, and mortality. 
      Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Fifty of 211 
      (24%) patients screened positive for probable cognitive impairment (Mini-Cog less 
      than or equal to 2). On age-adjusted multivariate analysis, patients with a Mini-Cog 
      score less than or equal to 2 were more likely to be discharged to a place other 
      than home (67% vs. 34%; odds ratio = 3.88, 95% CI = 1.58 to 9.55), develop 
      postoperative delirium (21% vs. 7%; odds ratio = 4.52, 95% CI = 1.30 to 15.68), and 
      have a longer hospital length of stay (hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.42 to 0.95) 
      compared to those with a Mini-Cog score greater than 2. CONCLUSIONS: Many older 
      elective orthopedic surgical patients have probable cognitive impairment 
      preoperatively. Such impairment is associated with development of delirium 
      postoperatively, a longer hospital stay, and lower likelihood of going home upon 
      hospital discharge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Brief Pain Inventory-short form (BPI-sf) is widely used in 
      self-reported pain assessment, incorporates pain numeric rating scales (NRS) and is 
      commonly utilized in electronic format in clinical trials, however, there is no 
      published information about its usability as an electronic patient-reported outcome 
      (ePRO) measure. The objective of this qualitative study was threefold: 1) to better 
      understand pain experiences among patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma; 
      2) to assess the interpretability of the instructions, item stem, recall period, and 
      response option of the "worst pain" item of the BPI-sf; and 3) to examine the 
      usability of the TrialMax Touch™ (CRF Health, Inc., Plymouth Meeting, PA) 
      screen-based handheld device and the electronic format of the BPI-sf in a sub-sample 
      of pleural mesothelioma patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional qualitative study was 
      conducted among participants with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma recruited from 
      4 clinical sites in the US. Semi-structured telephone or in-person interviews were 
      conducted consisting of concept elicitation, cognitive interviewing of the 11-item 
      BPI-sf, and in-person interview evaluation of ePRO assessment usability in pleural 
      mesothelioma patients. RESULTS: Twenty-one participants recruited from 4 clinical 
      sites in the US were interviewed in-person (n = 9) and by telephone (n = 12); 71% 
      male; mean age 68.7 ± 13.6 years. Pleural and peritoneal patients described pain as 
      ranging from discomfort to intense pain and reported being able to distinguish tumor 
      pain from treatment pain. The BPI-sf "worst pain" item was relevant to, and easily 
      understood by, study participants with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma. The ePRO 
      version was found to be easy to use, but readability of small font may be an issue. 
      Participants reported minimal differences between their responses on the paper and 
      ePRO version for all of the pain severity and pain interference items. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Results support the relevance and ease of understanding of the "worst pain" item and 
      provide support for its content validity in patients with pleural and peritoneal 
      mesothelioma. Usability of the ePRO format of the BPI-sf was confirmed for use in 
      clinical trials among patients with pleural mesothelioma.

TI  - Effect of Pain and Mild Cognitive Impairment on Mobility.
PG  - 138-43
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13869 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the effect of pain and mild cognitive impairment 
      (MCI)-together and separately-on performance-based and self-reported mobility 
      outcomes in older adults in primary care with mild to moderate self-reported 
      mobility limitations. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis. SETTING: Academic community 
      outpatient clinic. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals aged 65 and older in primary care 
      enrolled in the Boston Rehabilitative Impairment Study in the Elderly who were at 
      risk of mobility decline (N=430). MEASUREMENTS: Participants with an average score 
      greater than three on the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) were defined as having pain. 
      MCI was defined using age-adjusted scores on a neuropsychological battery. 
      Multivariable linear regression models assessed associations between pain and MCI, 
      together and separately, and mobility performance (habitual gait speed, Short 
      Physical Performance Battery), and self-reports of function and disability in 
      various day-to-day activities (Late Life Function and Disability Instrument). 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of pain was 34% and of MCI was 42%; 17% had pain only, 25% 
      had MCI only, 17% had pain and MCI, and 41% had neither. Participants with pain and 
      MCI performed significantly worse than all others on all mobility outcomes (P<.001). 
      Participants with MCI only or pain only also performed significantly worse on all 
      mobility outcomes than those with neither (P<.001). CONCLUSION: Mild to moderate 
      pain and MCI were independently associated with poor mobility, and the presence of 
      both comorbidities was associated with the poorest status. Primary care 
      practitioners who encounter older adults in need of mobility rehabilitation should 
      consider screening them for pain and MCI to better inform subsequent therapeutic 
      interventions.

TI  - Exploring the underlying mechanism of pain-related disability in hypermobile 
      adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
PG  - 22-31
LID - 10.1515/sjpain-2020-0023 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A significant proportion of adolescents with chronic musculoskeletal 
      pain (CMP) experience difficulties in physical functioning, mood and social 
      functioning, contributing to diminished quality of life. Generalized joint 
      hypermobility (GJH) is a risk factor for developing CMP with a striking 35-48% of 
      patients with CMP reporting GJH. In case GJH occurs with one or more musculoskeletal 
      manifestations such as chronic pain, trauma, disturbed proprioception and joint 
      instability, it is referred to as generalized hypermobility spectrum disorder 
      (G-HSD). Similar characteristics have been reported in children and adolescents with 
      the hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS). In the management of CMP, a 
      biopsychosocial approach is recommended as several studies have confirmed the impact 
      of psychosocial factors in the development and maintenance of CMP. The 
      fear-avoidance model (FAM) is a cognitive-behavioural framework that describes the 
      role of pain-related fear as a determinant of CMP-related disability. CONTENT: 
      Pubmed was used to identify existing relevant literature focussing on chronic 
      musculoskeletal pain, generalized joint hypermobility, pain-related fear and 
      disability. Relevant articles were cross-referenced to identify articles possibly 
      missed during the primary screening. In this paper the current state of scientific 
      evidence is presented for each individual component of the FAM in hypermobile 
      adolescents with and without CMP. Based on this overview, the FAM is proposed 
      explaining a possible underlying mechanism in the relations between GJH, 
      pain-related fear and disability. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: It is assumed that GJH seems 
      to make you more vulnerable for injury and experiencing more frequent 
      musculoskeletal pain. But in addition, a vulnerability for heightened pain-related 
      fear is proposed as an underlying mechanism explaining the relationship between GJH 
      and disability. Further scientific confirmation of this applied FAM is warranted to 
      further unravel the underlying mechanism.In explaining disability in individuals 
      with G-HSD/hEDS, it is important to focus on both the physical components related to 
      joint hypermobility, in tandem with the psychological components such as 
      pain-related fear, catastrophizing thoughts and generalized anxiety.

TI  - Chronic fatigue syndrome in the emergency department.
PG  - 15-28
LID - 10.2147/OAEM.S176843 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating disease characterized by 
      fatigue, postexertional malaise, cognitive dysfunction, sleep disturbances, and 
      widespread pain. A pilot, online survey was used to determine the common 
      presentations of CFS patients in the emergency department (ED) and attitudes about 
      their encounters. METHODS: The anonymous survey was created to score the severity of 
      core CFS symptoms, reasons for going to the ED, and Likert scales to grade attitudes 
      and impressions of care. Open text fields were qualitatively categorized to 
      determine common themes about encounters. RESULTS: Fifty-nine percent of respondents 
      with physician-diagnosed CFS (total n=282) had gone to an ED. One-third of ED 
      presentations were consistent with orthostatic intolerance; 42% of participants were 
      dismissed as having psychosomatic complaints. ED staff were not knowledgeable about 
      CFS. Encounters were unfavorable (3.6 on 10-point scale). The remaining 41% of 
      subjects did not go to ED, stating nothing could be done or they would not be taken 
      seriously. CFS subjects can be identified by a CFS questionnaire and the prolonged 
      presence (>6 months) of unremitting fatigue, cognitive, sleep, and postexertional 
      malaise problems. CONCLUSION: This is the first investigation of the presentation of 
      CFS in the ED and indicates the importance of orthostatic intolerance as the most 
      frequent acute cause for a visit. The self-report CFS questionnaire may be useful as 
      a screening instrument in the ED. Education of ED staff about modern concepts of CFS 
      is necessary to improve patient and staff satisfaction. Guidance is provided for the 
      diagnosis and treatment of CFS in these challenging encounters.

TI  - The Therapeutic Potential and Usage Patterns of Cannabinoids in People with Spinal 
      Cord Injuries: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 402-432
LID - 10.2174/1570159X18666200420085712 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People with spinal cord injuries (SCI) commonly experience pain and 
      spasticity; limitations of current treatments have generated interest in cannabis as 
      a possible therapy. OBJECTIVES: We conducted this systematic review to: 1) examine 
      usage patterns and reasons for cannabinoid use, and 2) determine the treatment 
      efficacy and safety of cannabinoid use in people with SCI. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, 
      Web of Science and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature 
      databases were queried for keywords related to SCI and cannabinoids. RESULTS: 7,232 
      studies were screened, and 34 were included in this systematic review. Though 26 
      studies addressed cannabinoid usage, only 8 investigated its therapeutic potential 
      on outcomes such as pain and spasticity. The most common method of use was smoking. 
      Relief of pain, spasticity and recreation were the most common reasons for use. A 
      statistically significant reduction of pain and spasticity was observed with 
      cannabinoid use in 83% and 100% of experimental studies, respectively. However, on 
      examination of randomized control trials (RCTs) alone, effect sizes ranged from - 
      0.82 to 0.83 for pain and -0.95 to 0.09 for spasticity. Cannabinoid use was 
      associated with fatigue and cognitive deficits. CONCLUSION: Current evidence 
      suggests that cannabinoids may reduce pain and spasticity in people with SCI, but 
      its effect magnitude and clinical significance are unclear. Existing information is 
      lacking on optimal dosage, method of use, composition and concentration of 
      compounds. Long-term, double-blind, RCTs, assessing a wider range of outcomes should 
      be conducted to further understand the effects of cannabinoid use in people with 
      SCI.

TI  - Children's self-report of pain intensity: what we know, where we are headed.
PG  - 39-45
AB  - The present paper provides a short, practical introduction to children's self-report 
      measures of pain intensity, followed by an overview of principles and issues. 
      Details on individual self-report scales were previously reported in a landmark 
      systematic review in 2006 and will not be repeated here. Broader measurement issues 
      discussed here include interpretation of pain scores over time, across individuals 
      and in relation to contextual factors; special considerations affecting children 
      younger than six years of age; social communicative functions of pain reports; 
      cognitive developmental factors in understanding pain scales and their anchors; 
      screening for the ability to use self-report scales and training for children who do 
      not have this skill; level of measurement (interval versus ordinal); estimating 
      clinically significant change for groups and individuals; and measurement of aspects 
      of pain other than intensity. Also highlighted are areas in which there has been 
      progress and a lack of progress since the last time this topic was featured at the 
      International Forum on Pediatric Pain in 1996. The present article closes with an 
      outline of key areas for further research on children's self-report of pain and a 
      brief summary of recommendations for clinicians.

TI  - Sleep disturbance predicts future health status after stroke.
PG  - 1863-1870
LID - 10.5664/jcsm.8700 [doi]
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: We evaluated factors associated with the presence of sleep 
      disturbance in patients with stroke and whether sleep disturbance predicted change 
      in other patient-reported domains of health over time. METHODS: Observational cohort 
      study of 2,190 patients with stroke seen in a cerebrovascular clinic February 17, 
      2015 to July 5, 2017 who completed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at ≥ 1 
      visit, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression screen, Quality of 
      Life in Neurological Disorders (NeuroQoL) cognitive function and Patient-Reported 
      Outcomes Information Measurement System (PROMIS) sleep disturbance, fatigue, 
      anxiety, social role satisfaction, physical function, and pain interference. 
      Separate multivariable models were constructed with PROMIS sleep disturbance as the 
      dependent variable. Covariates included clinical and demographic variables, the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression screen scored on the PROMIS metric, and 1 
      of the 6 other PROMs. Among the 476 patients with ≥ 2 visits, linear regression 
      models were constructed to determine the association of baseline sleep disturbance 
      with follow-up PROMs after adjustment for the corresponding baseline PROMIS/NeuroQol 
      scores, depression score, and clinical variables. RESULTS: Younger age and all PROM 
      scores were associated with sleep disturbance; depression had the greatest 
      association among PROMs (beta estimate 0.53, 95% confidence interval, 0.49, 0.57), 
      physical function had the least (-0.06, 95% confidence interval, -0.11, -0.01). 
      Baseline PROMIS sleep disturbance score was associated with worse adjusted follow-up 
      scores for depression, fatigue, social role satisfaction, and physical function. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Younger age and all 8 PROMs were associated with sleep disturbance in 
      patients with stroke. The degree of sleep disturbance predicted future 
      patient-reported outcomes for multiple domains of health. Further study is warranted 
      to determine if interventions shown to improve sleep symptoms will also improve 
      other outcomes.

TI  - Neuropsychological Functioning of Youth Receiving Intensive Interdisciplinary Pain 
      Treatment.
PG  - 870-881
LID - 10.1093/jpepsy/jsy034 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chronic pain is associated with school difficulties; however, there is 
      limited published evidence on the cognitive or neuropsychological functioning of 
      youth with chronic pain. METHOD: When beginning intensive interdisciplinary pain 
      treatment, 94 youth (age = 10-18) with chronic pain completed neuropsychological 
      assessment (e.g., intelligence, academic skills, learning and recall, and attention) 
      and clinical questionnaires (e.g., pain and physical and psychological functioning). 
      We compared neuropsychological scores with test norms and with clinical 
      questionnaires. RESULTS: Youth with chronic pain had higher verbal comprehension and 
      full scale IQ scores than expected, below-average nondominant hand dexterity, and 
      difficulty with visual recall. Self-reported difficulties with executive functioning 
      were associated with small-to-moderate difficulties with objectively measured 
      attention. Performance on neuropsychological measures was generally not associated 
      with pain, impairment, anxiety, or depression, though catastrophizing was negatively 
      correlated with perceptual reasoning. An expected number of these youth had learning 
      disorders (14%); however, more than expected had an autism spectrum disorder (9%) or 
      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (18%), and nearly a quarter demonstrated 
      characteristics of nonverbal learning disability (22%). CONCLUSIONS: Some of these 
      cognitive findings may be a consequence of chronic pain, and others may reflect 
      subtle neurodevelopmental differences that may predate or be comorbid with pain. 
      Regardless of etiology, with more than half the current sample experiencing some 
      type of learning challenge, often undiagnosed, pediatric psychologists evaluating 
      youth with chronic pain may wish to screen for comorbid learning difficulties.

LID - S0149-7634(19)30193-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.05.025 [doi]
AB  - Studies related to psychopathy and EEG have increased over the past decade making it 
      a good time to examine where the field is on this topic as well as to determine 
      future directions. The current study reviewed 68 research reports that focused on 
      psychopathy and various components of EEG. We examined early, mid, and late level 
      ERP processing as well as spectra analyses. The results indicate that psychopathic 
      individuals exhibit generally unencumbered performance categorizing cognitive 
      stimuli and demonstrate the typical facilitation of physical responses commensurate 
      with an intact orienting response. Moreover, the results suggest that individuals 
      with elevated psychopathic traits are especially adept at screening out distracting 
      threat-related and other irrelevant information allowing them to allocate attention 
      to stimuli that are goal-relevant. Those with elevated psychopathic traits also do 
      not appear to have significant impairments in associative learning or error 
      processing. Where psychopathic individuals diverge most from those with low levels 
      of these traits is in relation to processing affect-laden content. In some contexts, 
      psychopathic individuals appear to quickly terminate the processing of emotional 
      information and in other contexts (e.g., seeing others in pain) they elaborately 
      process emotional information both of which may help explain their prototypical lack 
      of conscience. Much of the aberrant functioning of those with elevated psychopathic 
      traits depends on the psychopathy factor being examined with F1 traits showing less 
      cognitive impairment than F2 traits. Recommendations for future research are 
      provided.

TI  - The role of psychological factors in pediatric functional abdominal pain disorders.
PG  - e13538
LID - 10.1111/nmo.13538 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric functional abdominal pain disorders (FAPDs) are disorders of 
      brain-gut dysregulation. Psychological factors are known to be related to etiology, 
      maintenance, and exacerbation of pediatric FAPDs. With the evolving literature in 
      the past two decades, a better understanding has emerged of precisely which 
      psychological factors are associated with childhood FAPDs. PURPOSE: This narrative 
      literature review summarizes the literature of both child and parent psychological 
      factors in pediatric FAPD. Where anxiety and depression were major targets in the 
      older literature, present-day focus is increasingly on pain-specific cognitions and 
      coping strategies including disease threat and catastrophizing. In addition, 
      parental reaction to a child's pain is increasingly recognized as an important 
      moderator of a child's outcomes and has become an area for clinical intervention. 
      Screening for these factors and integrative treatment approaches are recommended in 
      childhood FAPD.

TI  - PRISM: a brief screening tool to identify risk in parents of youth with chronic 
      pain.
PG  - 367-374
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000001403 [doi]
AB  - Having a child with chronic pain impacts a parent's life. Reciprocally, parent 
      cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to the child's chronic pain can 
      influence the child's pain experience. The purpose of this study is to develop a 
      brief self-report screening tool (Parent Risk and Impact Screening Measure [PRISM]) 
      of parent psychosocial functioning and behavioral responses to child pain. This 
      measure assesses parents' reports of their own stress, health, psychosocial 
      functioning, and disruption in activities due to their child's pain and related 
      disability. In an effort to preliminarily validate this screening tool, we examined 
      the PRISM in relation to existing measures of parent distress, parent behavior, and 
      child functioning. An initial 30-item PRISM was administered to 229 parents of 
      children with persistent pain. Parents also reported on distress, protectiveness, 
      pain catastrophizing and family impact, and youth completed measures of pain, 
      pain-related disability, and quality of life. Item refinement resulted in a final 
      12-item PRISM tool. The PRISM demonstrates strong internal consistency, and initial 
      support for construct validity was shown by associations with parent distress, 
      protectiveness, and catastrophizing. Results also revealed higher PRISM scores are 
      associated with higher child pain intensity, greater functional disability, and 
      poorer quality of life. Cutoff scores were determined to identify parents at 
      differing levels of risk. The PRISM is a brief and clinically important means of 
      screening parent distress and behaviors associated with child pain-related 
      dysfunction. Further validation will use PRISM in longitudinal studies, particularly 
      testing PRISM scores as a predictor of parent and child outcomes over time.

TI  - Assessment and Management of Delirium in Critically Ill Veterans.
PG  - 42-52
LID - 10.4037/ccn2020137 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is a complex syndrome prevalent in the intensive care unit. It 
      has been associated with significant morbidity including distress, longer hospital 
      stays, prolonged cognitive impairment, and increased mortality. OBJECTIVE: To 
      describe a nurse-led interdisciplinary quality improvement initiative to increase 
      nurses' knowledge of delirium, documentation of delirium assessment, and patient 
      mobility. METHODS: Sixty-seven nurses in medical and surgical intensive care units 
      were required to attend an interactive education program on delirium assessment and 
      management. Scores on tests taken before and after the education program were used 
      to evaluate knowledge. Medical records and bedside rounds were used to validate 
      Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit documentation and 
      interventions. Descriptive statistics were used to describe changes over time. A 
      delirium resource team composed of nurses, physicians, and therapists provided 
      didactic education paired with simulation training and bedside coaching. Mobility 
      screening tests and computer templates guided assessments and interventions. 
      RESULTS: Documentation of the Confusion Assessment Method improved from less than 
      50% to consistently 99%. Mobilization in the surgical intensive care unit increased 
      from 90% to 98% after intervention. Days of delirium significantly decreased from 
      51% before intervention to 31% after intervention (χ12=7.01, P = .008). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The success of this quality improvement project to enhance recognition of delirium 
      and increase mobility (critical components of the pain assessment, breathing, 
      sedation choice, delirium, early mobility, and family education bundle) was 
      contingent on nursing leaders hip, interdisciplinary team collaboration, and 
      interactive education.

TI  - Systematic review: psychosocial factors associated with pain in inflammatory bowel 
      disease.
PG  - 715-729
LID - 10.1111/apt.14493 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a frequently reported symptom of inflammatory bowel disease 
      (IBD) experienced by patients in active disease and remission. Psychological factors 
      play a significant role in pain, but have not been systematically reviewed in IBD. 
      AIM: To review psychosocial factors associated with pain in adults diagnosed with 
      IBD. METHODS: Electronic (PsycInfo, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Web 
      of Science), and hand-searching were conducted February-May 2017. Two authors 
      carried out screening and data extraction. RESULTS: Fifteen studies including 5539 
      IBD patients were identified. Emotional, cognitive-behavioural and personality 
      factors were associated with IBD-pain. Depression and anxiety were the most commonly 
      explored constructs, followed by perceived stress and pain catastrophising, all of 
      which were positively associated with greater pain. Greater abdominal pain was 
      associated with a concurrent mood disorder over fivefold (OR 5.76, 95% CI 1.39, 
      23.89). Coping strategies and pain fear avoidance correlated with pain levels. 
      Perceived social support (r = .26) and internal locus of control (r = .33) 
      correlated with less pain. Patients reporting pain in IBD remission more frequently 
      had an existing diagnosis of a mood disorder, a chronic pain disorder and irritable 
      bowel syndrome. Six studies controlled for disease activity, of which 4 found that 
      psychosocial factors significantly predicted pain. The majority of studies (n = 10) 
      were of high quality. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors appear to play a significant 
      role in IBD-pain. Further research is required to explore psychosocial constructs in 
      relation to IBD-pain, with use of validated pain measures, large sample sizes and 
      clearer characterisation of disease activity.

TI  - Neuroticism predicts fear of falling after hip fracture.
PG  - 498-506
LID - 10.1002/gps.5261 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fear of falling (FoF) is common and associated with poorer functional 
      outcomes after hip fracture. We sought to differentiate patterns of FoF at 4 and 
      12 weeks after surgical repair for hip fracture and examine predictors of FoF. 
      METHODS/DESIGN: Secondary analysis of existing data from a 52-week prospective study 
      examining recovery after hip fracture. Participants (N = 263) were aged 60 and older 
      with recent hip fracture recruited from eight hospitals. FoF was measured 4 and 
      12 weeks postfracture with the Short Falls Efficacy Scale-International. Latent 
      class mixed models were constructed to identify distinct patterns of FoF from 4 to 
      12 weeks postfracture and predictors of FoF. Predictors examined included age, 
      gender, neuroticism, depression, negative affect, perceived social support, medical 
      comorbidity, functional ability, cognition, and pain. RESULTS: Three latent classes 
      of FoF were identified: a group with minimal FoF at weeks 4 and 12 (72%), a group 
      with high FoF that decreased (17%), and a group with high FoF that increased from 
      week 4 to 12 (11%). In a multivariate model, higher neuroticism was associated with 
      greater risk for high FoF (increasing or decreasing), whereas higher premorbid 
      medical comorbidity was associated with increasing FoF, poorer premorbid functional 
      ability was associated with decreasing FoF, and social support was not significantly 
      associated. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults with higher neuroticism are more likely to 
      have FoF in the first 12 weeks after a hip fracture. Screening for neuroticism in 
      health care settings might identify individuals who would benefit from interventions 
      to improve outcomes during recovery.

TI  - Non-motor symptoms are relevant and possibly treatable in hereditary spastic 
      paraplegia type 4 (SPG4).
PG  - 369-379
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09573-w [doi]
AB  - Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) share as cardinal feature progressive spastic 
      gait disorder. SPG4 accounts for about 25% of cases and is caused by mutations in 
      the SPAST gene. Although HSP is an upper motor neuron disease, the relevance of 
      non-motor symptoms is increasingly recognized because of the potential response to 
      treatment. Our study sets out to evaluate non-motor symptoms and their relevance 
      with regard to health-related quality of life. In 118 genetically confirmed SPG4 
      cases and age- and gender-matched controls, validated questionnaires were used to 
      evaluate fatigue, depression, pain, and restless legs syndrome. In addition, 
      self-reported medical information was collected concerning comorbidities and 
      bladder, bowel, and sexual dysfunction. In a sub-study, cognition was evaluated 
      using the CANTAB(®) test-battery and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in 26 SPG4 
      patients. We found depression and pain to be significantly increased. The frequency 
      of restless legs syndrome varied largely depending on defining criteria. There were 
      no significant deficits in cognition as examined by CANTAB(®) despite a significant 
      increase in self-reported memory impairment in SPG4 patients. Bladder, sexual, and 
      defecation problems were frequent and seemed to be underrecognized in current 
      treatment strategies. All identified non-motor symptoms correlated with 
      health-related quality of life, which was reduced in SPG4 compared to controls. We 
      recommend that clinicians regularly screen for depression, pain, and fatigue and ask 
      for bladder, sexual, and defecation problems to recognize and treat non-motor 
      symptoms accordingly to improve quality of life in patients with SPG4.

AB  - While aesthetic experiences are not limited to any particular context, their 
      sensorial, cognitive and behavioral properties can be profoundly affected by the 
      circumstances in which they occur. Given the ubiquitous nature of contextual effects 
      in nearly all aspects of behavior, investigations aimed at delineating the 
      context-dependent and context-independent aspects of aesthetic experience and 
      engagement with aesthetic objects in a diverse range of settings are important in 
      empirical aesthetics. Here, we analyze the viewing behavior of visitors (N = 19) 
      freely viewing 15 paintings in the 20th-century Australian collection room at the 
      Art Gallery of New South Wales. In particular, we focus on how aspects of viewing 
      behavior including viewing distance in the gallery condition and eye gaze measures 
      such as fixation count, total fixation duration and average fixation duration are 
      affected by the artworks' physical characteristics including size and image 
      statistics properties such as Fourier amplitude spectrum, fractal dimension and 
      entropy. In addition, the same artworks were viewed in the laboratory, either scaled 
      to fit most of the screen (N = 22) or to preserve their relative size as in the 
      museum condition (N = 17) to assess the robustness of these relationships across 
      different presentation contexts. We find that the effects of presentation context 
      are modulated by the artworks' physical characteristics.

TI  - eHealth and mHealth Psychosocial Interventions for Youths With Chronic Illnesses: 
      Systematic Review.
PG  - e22329
LID - 10.2196/22329 [doi]
LID - e22329
AB  - BACKGROUND: An estimated 12.8% of children and adolescents experience chronic health 
      conditions that lead to poor quality of life, adjustment and coping issues, and 
      concurrent mental health problems. Digital health deployment of psychosocial 
      interventions to support youth with chronic illness has become increasingly popular 
      with the advent of the technological advances in the digital age. OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objectives were to systematically review published efficacy studies of eHealth and 
      mHealth (mobile health) psychosocial interventions for youths with chronic illnesses 
      and review intervention theory and treatment components. METHODS: PubMed, Embase, 
      Web of Science, PsycInfo, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were searched 
      for studies published from 2008 to 2019 of eHealth and mHealth psychosocial 
      interventions designed for children and adolescents with chronic illnesses in which 
      efficacy outcomes were reported. We excluded studies of interventions for 
      caregivers, healthy youth, disease and medication management, and telehealth 
      interventions that function solely as a platform to connect patients to providers 
      via phone, text, or videoconference. RESULTS: We screened 2551 articles and 133 
      relevant full-text articles. Sixteen efficacy studies with psychosocial and health 
      outcomes representing 12 unique interventions met the inclusion criteria. Of the 
      included studies, 12 were randomized controlled trials and 4 were prospective cohort 
      studies with no comparison group. Most interventions were based in cognitive 
      behavioral theory and designed as eHealth interventions; only 2 were designed as 
      mHealth interventions. All but 2 interventions provided access to support staff via 
      text, phone, email, or discussion forums. The significant heterogeneity in 
      intervention content, intervention structure, medical diagnoses, and outcomes 
      precluded meta-analysis. For example, measurement time points ranged from 
      immediately postcompletion of the mHealth program to 18 months later, and we 
      identified 39 unique outcomes of interest. The majority of included studies (11/16, 
      69%) reported significant changes in measured health and/or psychosocial 
      posttreatment outcomes, with small to large effect sizes. CONCLUSIONS: Although the 
      available literature on the efficacy of eHealth and mHealth psychosocial 
      interventions for youth with chronic illnesses is limited, preliminary research 
      suggests some evidence of positive treatment responses. Future studies should 
      continue to evaluate whether digital health platforms may be a viable alternative 
      model of delivery to traditional face-to-face approaches.

AB  - Considering the high prevalence of abdominal pain in children and adolescents in 
      Iran, it is essential to use appropriate screening tools. One of the most 
      comprehensive, yet concise, tools for this purpose is the Abdominal Pain Index 
      (API). This study aimed to investigate the psychometric properties of the Persian 
      version of the self-report API in adolescents. In this descriptive study, A total of 
      162 Iranian adolescents in the age range of 12 to 18 years were considered as the 
      sample group, which included two groups of school students (n = 125) and adolescent 
      patients with abdominal pain (n = 37). Clinical sample was selected by the available 
      sampling method, and nonclinical sample was selected by the cluster sampling method. 
      Adolescents in the sample group were selected from both clinical and nonclinical 
      groups in order to evaluate differential validity. Instruments, including API, 
      somatic symptoms subscale of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ), and McGill Pain 
      Questionnaire (MPQ), were also completed for the participants. Also, to evaluate the 
      construct validity of API, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis methods were 
      applied. The exploratory factor analysis identified one general factor, and the 
      confirmatory factor analysis results show the model's satisfactory fitting. Also, 
      the researchers' hypothesis, i.e., API is a single-factor model (with five items), 
      was approved. The reliability coefficient of the questionnaire was satisfactory for 
      the total scale (α < 0.7). This study showed that API could be used with 
      considerable confidence for Iranian children and adolescents with chronic pain.

AB  - For elderly patients undergoing elective surgical procedures, preoperative 
      evaluation of cognition is often overlooked. Patients may experience postoperative 
      delirium (POD) and postoperative cognitive decline (POCD), especially those with 
      certain risk factors, including advanced age. Preoperative cognitive impairment is a 
      leading risk factor for both POD and POCD, and studies have noted that identifying 
      these deficiencies is critical during the preoperative period so that appropriate 
      preventive strategies can be implemented. Comprehensive geriatric assessment is a 
      useful approach which evaluates a patient's medical, psycho-social, and functional 
      domains objectively. Various screening tools are available for preoperatively 
      identifying patients with cognitive impairment. The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery 
      (ERAS) protocols have been discussed in the context of prehabilitation as an effort 
      to optimize a patient's physical status prior to surgery and decrease the risk of 
      POD and POCD. Evidence-based protocols are warranted to standardize care in efforts 
      to effectively meet the needs of these patients.

TI  - Depression and anxiety symptoms are related to pain and frailty but not cognition or 
      delirium in older surgical patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In community dwelling older adults, depression and anxiety symptoms can 
      be associated with early cognitive decline. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are 
      common in older adults prior to surgery. However, their significance is unknown. Our 
      objective was to determine whether preoperative depression and anxiety symptoms are 
      associated with postoperative cognitive decline (POCD) and in-hospital delirium, in 
      older surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction in a cohort study of patients 65 and older 
      undergoing elective noncardiac surgery. We used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS) to screen for depression and anxiety symptoms at a home visit prior to 
      surgery and 3 months after surgery. Patients with a history of psychiatric (major 
      depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia) or neurologic disorder 
      (Parkinson's disease and stroke) were excluded from the parent study. RESULTS: Out 
      of the 167 patients, 9.6% (n = 16) reported significant depressive symptoms and 
      21.6% (n = 36) reported significant anxiety symptoms on preoperative screening. 
      There was no association between preoperative or new-onset postoperative depression 
      and anxiety symptoms and the incidence of delirium or POCD three months after 
      surgery. Patients with preoperative depressive symptoms had higher preoperative pain 
      (scores 69 vs. 35.7, p = .002) and frailty (56 vs. 14.6, p <.001). CONCLUSION: In 
      our cohort, we did not detect an association between preoperative depression and 
      anxiety symptoms and neurocognitive disorders. Preoperative depression and anxiety 
      symptoms were related to physical pain and frailty. Taken together, these suggest 
      that in patients without a formal psychiatric diagnosis, preoperative depression and 
      anxiety symptoms are related to physical state rather than a harbinger of early 
      cognitive decline. Future studies are needed to understand the nature of the 
      relationship between depression and anxiety symptoms and physical state in surgical 
      patients.

TI  - Placebo Effect on Modulating Empathic Pain: Reduced Activation in Posterior Insula.
PG  - 8

LID - 8
AB  - Little evidence exists to confirm whether the sensory-related neural activity that 
      occurs when observing others in pain is highly responsive to empathy for pain. From 
      a perspective of intervention, the present study employed placebo manipulation with 
      a transferable paradigm to explore whether the sensory regional activation that 
      occurs when viewing pictures of others in pain could be modulated by the placebo 
      effect. We first performed a screening behavioral experiment for selecting placebo 
      responders and then entered them into a functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) 
      experiment in which they were exposed to the same conditions as before. Participants 
      were informed that it was equally possible to be assigned to the treatment group 
      (placebo manipulation) or the no-treatment group (control); they all, in fact, 
      received treatment and placebo effect would be detected by comparing placebo 
      conditions and no-placebo control condition. Each participant experienced a phase of 
      reinforcing placebo belief with pain in self and a phase of testing transferable 
      placebo effect on empathy for pain. As a result, we found significant activation in 
      sensory areas, including the posterior insula (PI) and the postcentral gyrus, and in 
      the middle cingulate cortex while participants observed pictures of others in pain. 
      More importantly, for the first time, we observed relieved activation in the PI 
      modulated by the placebo effect only associated with pain pictures but not with 
      no-pain pictures. This suggests that sensory activity in the PI might be involved in 
      the processing for empathic pain. This new approach sheds light on research and 
      applications in clinical settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anterior cingulotomy (AC) was originally used to treat patients with a 
      psychiatric disorder, but it is also useful for treating patients with chronic 
      intractable pain. We reviewed 24 patients at our hospital who underwent AC for 
      chronic intractable pain to determine whether surgery influenced patient cognition 
      and the pain circuit. METHODS: A visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate 
      patients' pain scale preoperatively, at 1 month and 3-6 months postoperatively, and 
      at the final follow-up. Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Abilities 
      Screening Instrument (CASI) were used to evaluate postoperative cognitive function. 
      The latencies of peaks P20 and P37 of the somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) 
      conductive time were used to evaluate the intactness of the thalamocortical tract 
      after AC. RESULTS: The median preoperative VAS score was 8, MMSE score was 27, and 
      CASI score was 86.8. Six patients underwent a reoperation because of recurrent pain. 
      Pain was significantly reduced after AC, and the median VAS score at the last 
      follow-up was 5. There was no significant pain improvement in patients who underwent 
      a reoperation. There were no significant changes in MMSE and CASI scores or SSEP 
      after cingulotomy. There were no operation-related complications in the patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: A stereotactic AC was safe and effective in resolving chronic 
      refractory pain. It did not affect patient cognition or the sensory conductive 
      pathway. However, patients who had recurrent intractable pain after a cingulotomy 
      did not respond well to the reoperation.

AB  - The endocannabinoid and opioid systems are two interplaying neurotransmitter systems 
      that modulate drug abuse, anxiety, pain, cognition, neurogenesis and immune 
      activity. Although they are involved in such critical functions, our understanding 
      of endocannabinoid and opioid physiology remains limited, necessitating further 
      studies, novel models and new model organisms in this field. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) 
      is rapidly emerging as one of the most effective translational models in 
      neuroscience and biological psychiatry. Due to their high physiological and genetic 
      homology to humans, zebrafish may be effectively used to study the endocannabinoid 
      and opioid systems. Here, we discuss current models used to target the 
      endocannabinoid and opioid systems in zebrafish, and their potential use in future 
      translational research and high-throughput drug screening. Emphasizing the high 
      degree of conservation of the endocannabinoid and opioid systems in zebrafish and 
      mammals, we suggest zebrafish as an excellent model organism to study these systems 
      and to search for the new drugs and therapies targeting their evolutionarily 
      conserved mechanisms.

      the impact of opioids on cognition in older adults with cancer/chronic noncancer 
      pain, and screening tools/neuropsychological assessments used to detect 
      opioid-induced cognitive impairment. METHODS: A systematic literature review 
      following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis 
      Protocols (international prospective register of systematic reviews registration: 
      CRD42018092943). MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and Web of 
      Science were searched up to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials, 
      quasi-experimental studies, and observational studies of adults aged 65 years and 
      older with cancer/chronic noncancer pain taking opioids were included. A narrative 
      synthesis was conducted. RESULTS: From 4036 records, 10 met inclusion criteria. Five 
      studies used one screening tool, and five studies used a range of neuropsychological 
      assessments; assessing 14 cognitive domains. Most studies demonstrated no effect of 
      opioid use on cognitive domains, whereas four studies showed mixed effects. In 
      particular, attention, language, orientation, psychomotor function, and verbal 
      working/delayed episodic memory were worsened. Changes to cognitive function were 
      predominantly observed in studies with higher mean doses of opioids (120-190.7mg 
      oral morphine equivalent daily dose). CONCLUSION: Both improvements and impairments 
      to cognition were observed in studies with higher mean opioid doses. In clinical 
      practice, a brief screening tool assessing attention, language, orientation, 
      psychomotor function, and verbal working/delayed episodic memory may be beneficial 
      to detect worsening cognition in older adults with chronic pain using opioids.

AB  - Gulf War Illness (GWI), a chronic multisymptom health problem, afflicts ~30% of 
      veterans served in the first GW. Impaired brain function is among the most 
      significant symptoms of GWI, which is typified by persistent cognitive and mood 
      impairments, concentration problems, headaches, chronic fatigue, and musculoskeletal 
      pain. This review aims to discuss findings from animal prototypes and veterans with 
      GWI on mechanisms underlying its pathophysiology and emerging therapeutic strategies 
      for alleviating brain dysfunction in GWI. Animal model studies have linked brain 
      impairments to incessantly elevated oxidative stress, chronic inflammation, 
      inhibitory interneuron loss, altered lipid metabolism and peroxisomes, mitochondrial 
      dysfunction, modified expression of genes relevant to cognitive function, and waned 
      hippocampal neurogenesis. Furthermore, the involvement of systemic alterations such 
      as the increased intensity of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines 
      in the blood, transformed gut microbiome, and activation of the adaptive immune 
      response have received consideration. Investigations in veterans have suggested that 
      brain dysfunction in GWI is linked to chronic activation of the executive control 
      network, impaired functional connectivity, altered blood flow, persistent 
      inflammation, and changes in miRNA levels. Lack of protective alleles from Class II 
      HLA genes, the altered concentration of phospholipid species and proinflammatory 
      factors in the circulating blood have also been suggested as other aiding factors. 
      While some drugs or combination therapies have shown promise for alleviating 
      symptoms in clinical trials, larger double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are 
      needed to validate such findings. Based on improvements seen in animal models of 
      GWI, several antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds are currently being tested 
      in clinical trials. However, reliable blood biomarkers that facilitate an 
      appropriate screening of veterans for brain pathology need to be discovered. A 
      liquid biopsy approach involving analysis of brain-derived extracellular vesicles in 
      the blood appears efficient for discerning the extent of neuropathology both before 
      and during clinical trials.

TI  - The Gut Microbiome Feelings of the Brain: A Perspective for Non-Microbiologists.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms5040066 [doi]
LID - 66
AB  - Objectives: To comprehensively review the scientific knowledge on the gut-brain 
      axis. Methods: Various publications on the gut-brain axis, until 31 July 2017, were 
      screened using the Medline, Google, and Cochrane Library databases. The search was 
      performed using the following keywords: "gut-brain axis", "gut-microbiota-brain 
      axis", "nutrition microbiome/microbiota", "enteric nervous system", "enteric glial 
      cells/network", "gut-brain pathways", "microbiome immune system", "microbiome 
      neuroendocrine system" and "intestinal/gut/enteric neuropeptides". Relevant articles 
      were selected and reviewed. Results: Tremendous progress has been made in exploring 
      the interactions between nutrients, the microbiome, and the intestinal, 
      epithelium-enteric nervous, endocrine and immune systems and the brain. The basis of 
      the gut-brain axis comprises of an array of multichannel sensing and trafficking 
      pathways that are suggested to convey the enteric signals to the brain. These are 
      mediated by neuroanatomy (represented by the vagal and spinal afferent neurons), the 
      neuroendocrine-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (represented by the gut 
      hormones), immune routes (represented by multiple cytokines), microbially-derived 
      neurotransmitters, and finally the gate keepers of the intestinal and brain 
      barriers. Their mutual and harmonious but intricate interaction is essential for 
      human life and brain performance. However, a failure in the interaction leads to a 
      number of inflammatory-, autoimmune-, neurodegenerative-, metabolic-, mood-, 
      behavioral-, cognitive-, autism-spectrum-, stress- and pain-related disorders. The 
      limited availability of information on the mechanisms, pathways and cause-and-effect 
      relationships hinders us from translating and implementing the knowledge from the 
      bench to the clinic. Implications: Further understanding of this intricate field 
      might potentially shed light on novel preventive and therapeutic strategies to 
      combat these disorders. Nutritional approaches, microbiome manipulations, enteric 
      and brain barrier reinforcement and sensing and trafficking modulation might improve 
      physical and mental health outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between cognitive deficits and health-related 
      quality of life in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). METHODS: The revised ALS 
      Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R for physical impairment), the ALS Assessment 
      Questionnaire (ALSAQ-40 for health-related quality of life) and the Edinburgh 
      Cognitive and Behavioral ALS Screen (ECAS for cognition) were assessed in 125 
      patients with ALS. Correlations between ALSAQ-40 domains and ECAS functions were 
      tested using Spearman correlation. Linear regression was used to evaluate the 
      relationship between dysphagia, depression, hopelessness, pain (all derived from 
      corresponding items from the ALSFRS-R or ALSAQ-40), ALSFRS-R, ECAS and the ALSAQ-40. 
      RESULTS: Verbal fluency, language and executive function were disturbed in 69 (55%), 
      54 (43%) and 41 (33%) patients, respectively. In the ALS non-specific domains the 
      memory and visuospatial function were impaired in 44 (35%) and 12 (10%) patients. In 
      the non-demented group the five ECAS functions did not correlate with the ALSAQ-40 
      subdomains. The ALSFRS-R score, hopelessness, pain, and depression explained 65% of 
      the ALSAQ-40 SI variance; the ECAS total score did not significantly predict 
      ALSAQ-40 summary index. The ECAS visuospatial, executive function and fluency 
      significantly predicted emotional well-being (adjusted R (2) = 0.08). When the model 
      was controlled for depression, hopelessness and pain none of the ECAS functions 
      (visuospatial, executive function and fluency) were significant predictors of 
      emotional well-being. CONCLUSION: Deficits in visuospatial function, executive 
      function and fluency constrain the ability to manage activities of daily living and 
      this might cause decline in well-being.

TI  - Aesthetic Evaluation of Digitally Reproduced Art Images.
PG  - 615575
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2020.615575 [doi]
LID - 615575
AB  - Most people encounter art images as digital reproductions on a computer screen 
      instead of as originals in a museum or gallery. With the development of digital 
      technologies, high-resolution artworks can be accessed anywhere and anytime by a 
      large number of viewers. Since these digital images depict the same content and are 
      attributed to the same artist as the original, it is often implicitly assumed that 
      their aesthetic evaluation will be similar. When it comes to the digital 
      reproductions of art, however, it is also obvious that reproductions do differ from 
      the originals in various aspects. Besides image quality, resolution, and format, the 
      most obvious change is in the representation of color. The effects of subjectively 
      varying surface-level image features on art evaluation have not been clearly 
      assessed. To address this gap, we compare the evaluation of digital reproductions of 
      16 expressionist and impressionist paintings manipulated to have a high color 
      saturation vs. a saturation similar to the original. We also investigate the impact 
      of viewing time (100 ms vs. unrestricted viewing time) and expertise (art experts 
      vs. laypersons), two other aspects that may impact the perception of art in online 
      contexts. Moreover, we link these dimensions to a recent model of aesthetic 
      experience [the Vienna Integrated Model of Top-Down and Bottom-Up Processes in Art 
      Perception (VIMAP)]. Results suggest that color saturation does not exert a major 
      influence on liking. Cognitive and emotional aspects (interest, confusion, surprise, 
      and boredom), however, are affected - to different extents for experts and 
      laypersons. For laypersons, the increase in color saturation led to more positive 
      assessments of an artwork, whereas it resulted in increased confusion for art 
      experts. This insight is particularly important when it comes to reproducing 
      artworks digitally. Depending on the intended use, increasing or decreasing the 
      color saturation of the digitally reproduced image might be most appropriate. We 
      conclude with a discussion of these findings and address the question of why 
      empirical aesthetics requires more precise dimensions to better understand the 
      subtle processes that take place in the perception of today's digitally reproduced 
      art environment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known on epidemiology of chronic pain in New Zealand. Its 
      management has been based on data and models in North American/European studies. 
      This project evaluated demographic and psychosocial correlates of pain severity, 
      duration, and disability (PSDD) in chronic pain patients for assessment at a New 
      Zealand tertiary care Pain Medicine Center. DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was a 
      retrospective, cross-sectional analysis on existing clinical assessment data (audit) 
      collected over an 18-month period. METHODS: Pre-admission data were collected on a 
      consecutive series of 874 patients presenting for assessment. ASSESSMENT TOOLS: This 
      included demographic (gender, educational attainment, ethnicity) and psychosocial 
      data. Pain severity was measured by numerical rating scale and present pain 
      intensity using McGill Pain Questionnaire. Duration was measured in months. 
      Disability was measured by using Pain Disability Index and depression using the 
      Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale. Distress was measured using the 
      Kessler Psychological Distress Scale and self-efficacy using the Pain Self-Efficacy 
      Questionnaire. Catastrophizing was measured by Coping Strategies Questionnaire and 
      pain acceptance by the Pain Solutions Questionnaire. RESULTS: No difference was 
      found in mean values of all PSDD between genders and between ethnicities. Years of 
      education did not form an important correlate of PSDD. Catastrophizers experienced 
      more pain and were more disabled. Patients with severe pain experienced greater 
      distress. Depressed patients were more disabled. Patients presenting with a high 
      degree of self-efficacy were likely to have lower pain levels and to be less 
      disabled. Level of acceptance of pain was positively associated with reported 
      duration of pain and negatively associated with total disability. CONCLUSION: 
      Through this study, more is now known about effects of chronic pain on New 
      Zealanders. The use of validated psychometric testing enables proper assessment and 
      informs clinical management for chronic pain patients.

AB  - Aim: To provide a detailed profile of Veteran and community patients with chronic 
      pain who completed preprocedural psychological evaluations for implantable pain 
      devices. Patients & methods: A total of 157 candidates completed a preimplantable 
      pain device evaluation between June 2018 and October 2019 with a pain psychologist 
      that included a structured interview, elicitation of patient-centered goals for the 
      implantable device, and psychometric testing. Results: Candidates demonstrated 
      moderate to high rates of sleep impairment (73%), depressive symptoms (62%), anxiety 
      symptoms (61%), pain catastrophizing (37%), cognitive impairment screen (30%) and 
      somatic symptoms (24%). Conclusion: Candidates for implantable pain devices report 
      high rates of mood, sleep and cognitive impairment, reinforcing the value of 
      preprocedural psychological evaluations.

TI  - Watching your pain site reduces pain intensity in chronic back pain patients.
PG  - 581-5
LID - 10.1002/ejp.765 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic back pain (CBP) is a frequent debilitating and often 
      treatment-resistant disorder. The awareness of one's own body seems to be essential 
      in pain reduction through visual input. Visual feedback of the back reduces 
      experimental pain perception in CBP at this site and watching the back during 
      repeated lumbar spine movements reduces movement-evoked pain. In this study, we 
      tested whether visual feedback alone can reduce habitual pain in CBP. METHODS: In a 
      within-subject design, 19 CBP patients participated in an online visual feedback 
      condition, watching one's own back. This was compared to several control conditions, 
      such as watching a neutral object (book), a video of another person of the same sex, 
      a picture of the own back, and keeping one's eyes closed in randomized order on five 
      separate days. In each experimental session, participants rated habitual pain 
      intensity and unpleasantness before and after the experimental manipulation. 
      RESULTS: We present evidence that visual feedback by watching the site of chronic 
      pain on a video screen alone is sufficient to reduce habitual chronic pain. No 
      additional manipulation or movement was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: These results 
      suggest that online video feedback may be helpful in alleviating chronic pain.

TI  - Pain Assessment of Elderly Patients with Cognitive Impairment in the Emergency 
      Department: Implications for Pain Management-A Narrative Review of Current 
      Practices.
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy5020030 [doi]
LID - 30
AB  - Elderly people are susceptible to both falls and cognitive impairment making them a 
      particularly vulnerable group of patients when it comes to pain assessment and 
      management in the emergency department (ED). Pain assessment is often difficult in 
      patients who present to the ED with a cognitive impairment as they are frequently 
      unable to self-report their level of pain, which can have a negative impact on pain 
      management. This paper aims to review how cognitive impairment influences pain 
      assessment in elderly adults who present to the ED with an injury due to a fall. A 
      literature search of EMBASE, ProQuest, PubMed, Science Direct, SciFinder and the 
      Curtin University Library database was conducted using keyword searches to generate 
      lists of articles which were then screened for relevance by title and then abstract 
      to give a final list of articles for full-text review. Further articles were 
      identified by snowballing from the reference lists of the full-text articles. The 
      literature reports that ED staff commonly use visual or verbal analogue scales to 
      assess pain, but resort to their own intuition or physiological parameters rather 
      than using standardised observational pain assessment tools when self-report of pain 
      is not attainable due to cognitive impairment. While studies have found that the use 
      of pain assessment tools improves the recognition and management of pain, pain 
      scores are often not recorded for elderly patients with a cognitive impairment in 
      the ED, leading to poorer pain management in this patient group in terms of time to 
      analgesic administration and the use of strong opioids. All healthcare professionals 
      involved in the care of such patients, including pharmacists, need to be aware of 
      this and strive to ensure analgesic use is guided by appropriate and accurate pain 
      assessment in the ED.

TI  - Application of autonomic nervous function evaluation to job stress screening.
PG  - e01194
LID - 10.1016/j.heliyon.2019.e01194 [doi]
LID - e01194
AB  - The present study focuses on the evaluation of autonomic nervous function, which is 
      increasingly being used as an objective measure of fatigue state. It has recently 
      been reported that autonomic nervous activity, which is expressed as total heart 
      rate variability (HRV) power, is associated with, and can be used as an objective 
      measure of, mental and physical fatigue. Total HRV power (log (LF + HF)) has been 
      shown to decline with ageing, and thus cannot be utilized as a fatigue index in 
      populations with a different age composition. In the present study, we devised 
      standard scores (deviation value) for autonomic nervous activity corrected for 
      individual age calculated from the distribution of such activity in individual age 
      cohorts. This allowed us to accurately evaluate an individual's autonomic nervous 
      activity, even when that individual was part of a group with members of different 
      ages. Standard scores were quantified using autonomic nervous function data gathered 
      from 1,969 healthy individuals (age range 20-77 years). The efficacy of this method 
      in mental health screening was investigated by evaluating both autonomic nervous 
      function and subjective levels of fatigue among corporate workers. Based on results 
      from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire recommended by the research team of the 
      Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 103 participants were divided into two 
      groups (a high-stress group [n = 17] and a non-high-stress group [n = 86]). Visual 
      analog scale (VAS) scores for all fatigue-related symptoms were significantly higher 
      among the high-stress than among the non-high-stress group (p < 0.01). The mean 
      standard score for autonomic nervous activity was 56.3 for the non-high-stress 
      group. The score for the high-stress group was significantly lower, at 47.9 (p < 
      0.01), indicating that autonomic nervous function was reduced among participants who 
      experienced high stress. According to an analysis of raw and standard scores in each 
      domain, autonomic nervous activity did not significantly correlate with 
      stress-causing factors (e.g., overwork) or other factors affecting stress responses 
      (e.g., support from supervisors and colleagues), but did exhibit a significant 
      positive correlation with physical and mental responses to stress (r = 0.334, p < 
      0.01). Lower raw scores for mental and physical responses to stress represent 
      stronger subjective symptoms. Moreover, greater stress responses were found to be 
      associated with lower standard scores for autonomic nervous activity. In terms of 
      fatigue-related symptoms rated using the VAS, autonomic nervous activity negatively 
      correlated with mental stress, physical stress, fatigue/malaise, depressed mood, 
      anxiety/fear, tension, irritation/anger, cognitive decline, and muscle/joint/general 
      pain, and positively correlated with motivation/vitality. Reduced autonomic nervous 
      activity was observed with high stress, confirming that standard scores for 
      autonomic nervous activity are associated with mental and physical responses to 
      stress and subjective fatigue-related symptoms. These results indicate that the 
      evaluation of autonomic nervous activity using standard scores (deviation value) is 
      a useful tool for the objective measurement of fatigue state, even in groups with 
      members of different ages, and can be applied as a useful objective health index to 
      evaluate industrial fatigue.

AB  - Objective: To study the risk of malnutrition and related factors of cancer patients 
      in community of Shanghai. Methods: From October 2018 to January 2019, four 
      communities, Pengpu New Village Street, Pengpu Town, Jiangning Road Street, and 
      Caojiadu Street, from 14 communities in Jing 'an District, Shanghai City, were 
      selected by using a random cluster sampling method based on the Shanghai Cancer 
      Registration and reporting system. All cases of malignant tumors and benign tumors 
      of the central nervous system were included. A total of 4 396 questionnaires were 
      distributed. After the exclusion of 9 invalid questionnaires, 3 310 valid 
      questionnaires were included with a rate of 99.73%. A self-designed questionnaire 
      was used to collect data including basic demographic characteristics, history of 
      malignant, physical and psychological pain, nutritional demands and cognitive 
      status. Malnutrition Universal Screening Tools (MUST) was used to analyze the 
      nutritional risk of cancer patients in the community. Multivariate logistic 
      regression model was applied to analyze potential factors. Results: Among the 3 310 
      cancer patients who completed the survey, the average age of study participants was 
      (64.05±13.02), and 1 467 cases (44.32%) were males. The incidence rate of 
      nutritional risk was 12.84% (425/3 310). The result of logistic regression analysis 
      showed that compared with male, other cancer patients and no physical pain, the risk 
      factors of the occurrence of nutritional included: female (OR=1.53,95%CI:1.23-1.92), 
      head and neck malignant tumors (OR=1.42,95%CI:1.07-1.90), bronchus/lung malignant 
      tumors (OR=1.93,95%CI:1.43-2.61), liver, biliary/pancreatic malignant tumors 
      (OR=2.11,95%CI:1.21-3.65) and upper gastrointestinal malignant tumors 
      (OR=6.04,95%CI:4.31-8.46), patients with physical pain (OR=1.39,95%CI:1.02-1.89). 
      Conclusion: Nutritional risk of cancer patients is higher in community of Shanghai. 
      Gender, location of tumors and physical pain are associated with the occurrence of 
      nutritional risk.

TI  - The Vulvar Pain Assessment Questionnaire inventory.
PG  - 2672-2686
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000000682 [doi]
AB  - Millions suffer from chronic vulvar pain (ie, vulvodynia). Vulvodynia represents the 
      intersection of 2 difficult subjects for health care professionals to tackle: 
      sexuality and chronic pain. Those with chronic vulvar pain are often uncomfortable 
      seeking help, and many who do so fail to receive proper diagnoses. The current 
      research developed a multidimensional assessment questionnaire, the Vulvar Pain 
      Assessment Questionnaire (VPAQ) inventory, to assist in the assessment and diagnosis 
      of those with vulvar pain. A large pool of items was created to capture pain 
      characteristics, emotional/cognitive functioning, physical functioning, coping 
      skills, and partner factors. The item pool was subsequently administered online to 
      288 participants with chronic vulvar pain. Of those, 248 participants also completed 
      previously established questionnaires that were used to evaluate the convergent and 
      discriminant validity of the VPAQ. Exploratory factor analyses of the item pool 
      established 6 primary scales: Pain Severity, Emotional Response, Cognitive Response, 
      and Interference with Life, Sexual Function, and Self-Stimulation/Penetration. A 
      brief screening version accompanies a more detailed version. In addition, 3 
      supplementary scales address pain quality characteristics, coping skills, and the 
      impact on one's romantic relationship. When relationships among VPAQ scales and 
      previously researched scales were examined, evidence of convergent and discriminant 
      validity was observed. These patterns of findings are consistent with the literature 
      on the multidimensional nature of vulvodynia. The VPAQ can be used for assessment, 
      diagnosis, treatment formulation, and treatment monitoring. In addition, the VPAQ 
      could potentially be used to promote communication between patients and providers, 
      and point toward helpful treatment options and/or referrals.

TI  - Scoping Review of Dance for Adults With Fibromyalgia: What Do We Know About It?
PG  - e10033
LID - 10.2196/10033 [doi]
LID - e10033
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread muscular 
      tenderness, pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. Nonpharmacological treatment 
      options, such as physical activity, are important for people with fibromyalgia. 
      There are strong recommendations to support engagement in physical activity for 
      symptom management among adults with fibromyalgia. Dance is a mode of physical 
      activity that may allow individuals with fibromyalgia to improve their physical 
      function, health, and well-being. Dance has the potential to promote improved pain 
      processing while simultaneously providing the health and social benefits of engaging 
      in physical activity that contributes to symptom management and overall function 
      rehabilitation. However, we are unaware of current evidence on dance as a 
      nonpharmacological/physical activity intervention for adults with fibromyalgia. 
      OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to understand how dance is used 
      therapeutically by individuals with fibromyalgia; to examine the extent, range and 
      nature of research activity in the area; and to determine the value of undertaking a 
      systematic review of interventions. METHODS: We used and adapted the Arksey and 
      O'Malley scoping framework. The search strategy involved a comprehensive search of 
      main health and electronic social databases, trial registries and grey literature 
      without language limits. Pairs of reviewers independently screened and extracted 
      data and evaluated the methodological quality of randomized control trials. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-one unique records for 13 studies met inclusion criteria; the studies 
      included mostly middle-aged women. Types of dance included were aerobic dance, belly 
      dance, dance movement therapy, biodanza and Zumba. Intervention parameters were 
      different among studies. Frequency varied between one to three times a week; all 
      were done in small group settings. Studies evaluated a variety of outcomes in the 
      symptoms, wellness, psychosocial, physical functioning, balance and fitness 
      categories; no studies evaluated the safety or adverse events systematically which 
      is a major weakness of the literature. CONCLUSIONS: There are few studies in the 
      field of dance and fibromyalgia, suggesting research is in its infancy but slowly 
      growing. They are of European and South American origin, focusing on female 
      participants and a limited number of dance modes. Because the body of literature is 
      small, of low quality and highly heterogeneous, we concluded that a systematic 
      review of interventions on dance is not warranted at this time.

TI  - The Effects of Alcohol Hangover on Mood and Performance Assessed at Home.
LID - 10.3390/jcm9041068 [doi]
LID - 1068
AB  - The current study evaluated the next day consequences of a social night of drinking 
      compared to a no alcohol night, with standardised mood and portable screen-based 
      performance measures assessed in the morning at participants' homes, and a 
      breathalyser screen for zero alcohol. A mixed sex group (n = 20) took part in the 
      study. Participants reported consuming on average 16.9 units (135 g) alcohol, 
      resulting in a hangover rating of 60 (out of 100) compared to 0.3 following the no 
      alcohol night. Statistical significance comparisons contrasting the hangover with 
      the no alcohol condition revealed an increase in negative mood and irritability 
      during hangover and an (unexpected) increase in risk and thrill seeking. Performance 
      scores showed an overall slowing of responses across measures, but with less impact 
      on errors. The results support the description of hangover as a general state of 
      cognitive impairment, reflected in slower responses and reduced accuracy across a 
      variety of measures of cognitive function. This suggests a general level of 
      impairment due to hangover, as well as increased negative mood. The use of a 
      naturalistic design enabled the impact of more typical levels of alcohol associated 
      with real life social consumption to be assessed, revealing wide ranging 
      neurocognitive impairment with these higher doses. This study has successfully 
      demonstrated the sensitivity of home-based assessment of the impact of alcohol 
      hangover on a range of subjective and objective measures. The observed impairments, 
      which may significantly impair daily activities such as driving a car or job 
      performance, should be further investigated and taken into account by policy makers.

      ambulatory surgical patient.
PG  - 732-739
LID - 10.1097/ACO.0000000000000901 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The number and the complexity of procedures taking place at 
      ambulatory surgery centers is steadily increasing. The rate at which medically 
      complex patients, including those with baseline neurocognitive disorders, are 
      undergoing ambulatory procedures is seeing a concurrent rise. Given the significant 
      physical and psychological stress associated with surgery even in the ambulatory 
      setting, it is essential to evaluate the ability of a patient to acclimate to 
      stressful triggers in order to assess risk of subpar medical outcomes and increased 
      mortality. In this review, we discuss recent advances in the assessment of both 
      cognition and frailty and describe the implementation of these tools in the 
      ambulatory surgery setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent Society for Perioperative 
      Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) recommendations for evaluating at-risk 
      patients focus on a two-pronged approach that encompasses screening for both 
      impaired cognition and frailty. Screening should ideally occur as early as possible, 
      but tools such as the Mini-Cog examination and FRAIL Questionnaire are efficient and 
      effective even when used the day of surgery in high-risk patients. SUMMARY: The 
      recognition of at-risk patients using standardized screening and the use of this 
      assessment to guide perioperative monitoring and interventions is essential for 
      optimizing outcomes for the complex ambulatory surgery patient.

TI  - A cross-sectional study on prevalence of pain and breakthrough pain among an 
      unselected group of outpatients in a tertiary cancer clinic.
PG  - 1965-71
LID - 10.1007/s00520-014-2178-3 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Systematic knowledge about the prevalence and the treatment effects of 
      cancer pain in patients attending a general oncology outpatient department is 
      limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of pain in a 
      large representative cohort of patients attending a general oncology outpatient 
      department in order to guide further screening, classification, and treatment of 
      pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study among patients visiting the 
      outpatient clinic with histologically verified cancer, age≥18 years, adequate 
      cognitive function, and no surgical procedures last 24 h were included. Pain was 
      assessed by the Brief Pain Inventory and the Alberta Breakthrough Pain Assessment 
      Tool. RESULTS: Three hundred five patients were included. The mean age was 60 years, 
      94% had a WHO performance status of 0-1 and 59% received oncological treatment with 
      a curative intent. The mean score for average pain last 24 h (numerical rating 
      scale, 0-10) and current pain was 1.84 and 1.08, respectively. Twenty-two percent 
      reported pain score of ≥4 as their average pain in the previous 24 h. Twenty-one 
      percent reported breakthrough pain (BTP). In multivariate analyses, sleep, BTP, age, 
      treatment intent, and comorbidity was significantly associated with mean average 
      pain in the previous 24 h and explained 29% of the variability of average pain in 
      the previous 24 h. CONCLUSION: Of the patients at an oncology outpatient clinic, 22% 
      reported clinically significant pain. These findings indicate that all patients are 
      candidates to be screened for pain and, if present, a more detailed pain diagnosis 
      should be established before any interventions can be recommended.

TI  - Effects of Intraperitoneal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) Administration on 
      Nociceptive/Repetitive Behaviors in Juvenile Mice.
PG  - 168-177
LID - 10.4062/biomolther.2018.230 [doi]
AB  - Dysregulation of excitatory neurotransmission has been implicated in the 
      pathogenesis of neuropsychiatric disorders. Pharmacological inhibition of 
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors is widely used to model neurobehavioral 
      pathologies and underlying mechanisms. There is ample evidence that overstimulation 
      of NMDA-dependent neurotransmission may induce neurobehavioral abnormalities, such 
      as repetitive behaviors and hypersensitization to nociception and cognitive 
      disruption, pharmacological modeling using NMDA has been limited due to the 
      induction of neurotoxicity and blood brain barrier breakdown, especially in young 
      animals. In this study, we examined the effects of intraperitoneal 
      NMDA-administration on nociceptive and repetitive behaviors in ICR mice. 
      Intraperitoneal injection of NMDA induced repetitive grooming and tail 
      biting/licking behaviors in a dose- and age-dependent manner. Nociceptive and 
      repetitive behaviors were more prominent in juvenile mice than adult mice. We did 
      not observe extensive blood brain barrier breakdown or neuronal cell death after 
      peritoneal injection of NMDA, indicating limited neurotoxic effects despite a 
      significant increase in NMDA concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid. These 
      findings suggest that the observed behavioral changes were not mediated by general 
      NMDA toxicity. In the hot plate test, we found that the latency of paw licking and 
      jumping decreased in the NMDA-exposed mice especially in the 75 mg/kg group, 
      suggesting increased nociceptive sensitivity in NMDA-treated animals. Repetitive 
      behaviors and increased pain sensitivity are often comorbid in psychiatric disorders 
      (e.g., autism spectrum disorder). Therefore, the behavioral characteristics of 
      intraperitoneal NMDA-administered mice described herein may be valuable for studying 
      the mechanisms underlying relevant disorders and screening candidate therapeutic 
      molecules.

AB  - Because of its unique evolutionary relevance, it is understood that pain 
      automatically attracts attention. So far, such attentional bias has mainly been 
      shown for pain-related stimuli whereas little is known about shifts in attentional 
      focus after actual painful stimulation. This study investigated attentional shifts 
      by assessing eye movements into the direction of painful stimulation. Healthy 
      participants were presented either a blank screen or a picture showing a natural 
      scene while painful electrical stimuli were applied to the left or right hand. In 
      general, painful stimulation reduced exploratory behavior as reflected by less and 
      slower saccades as well as fewer and longer fixations. Painful stimulation on the 
      right hand induced a rightward bias (ie, increased initial saccades, total number 
      and duration of fixations to the right hemifield of the screen). Pain applied to the 
      left hand as well as no pain induced a leftward bias that was largest for the 
      direction of first saccades. These findings are in line with previous observations 
      of attentional biases toward pain-related information and highlight eye tracking as 
      a valuable tool to assess involuntary attentional consequences of pain. Future 
      studies are needed to investigate how the observed changes in eye movements relate 
      to pain-induced changes in perception and cognition. PERSPECTIVE: The study 
      investigated pain-induced attentional shifts in terms of reflexive eye movements. 
      This attention-capturing quality of pain should be examined in chronic pain 
      conditions because it might contribute to the cognitive impairments often observed 
      in chronic pain patients.

TI  - Recognizing CADASIL: a Secondary Cause of Migraine with Aura.
PG  - 21
LID - 10.1007/s11916-017-0621-0 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: CADASIL (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with 
      subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) is an important disease to consider in 
      the differential diagnosis of migraine with aura. This review examines current 
      literature regarding migraine in CADASIL, as well as diagnostic and treatment 
      modalities. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have shown that smoking is a modifiable 
      risk factor for progression of CADASIL (Chabriat et al. in Stroke 47:4-11, 2015). 
      Specific imaging changes and findings on clinical exam can predict disease 
      progression. However, migraine symptoms often precede MRI changes (Guey et al. in 
      Cephalalgia 36:1038-47, 2015). A recent paper on migraine treatment in CADASIL 
      reevaluates the prevailing belief that vasoconstrictive abortive medications are 
      contraindicated in these patients (Tan and Markus in PLoS ONE 11:e0157613, 2016). 
      CADASIL is an autosomal dominantly inherited vasculopathy causing ischemic pathology 
      in younger individuals due to a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene. The mutation results in 
      impaired arterial contractility due to accumulation of granular osmiophilic 
      extracellular material (GOM) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Clinical 
      manifestations include migraine with and without aura, cognitive decline, ischemic 
      events, and mood disorders. The presenting symptom is often migraine with aura. 
      Characteristic MRI changes are often present. Genetic screening is available to 
      confirm NOTCH3 mutation and pathognomic changes are often seen in skin biopsy. 
      Treatment of migraine is similar to the general population, but with some notable 
      and specific differences. Further studies in CADASIL, other small vessel 
      arteriopathies, and migraine may help us understand more about the pathophysiology 
      of these conditions and help with treatment development.

AB  - Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is characterized by pain, motor and 
      inflammatory symptoms usually affecting one limb. Cognitive difficulties have been 
      reported to affect patients' ability to represent, perceive and use their affected 
      limb. It is debated whether these difficulties result from deficits in controlling 
      goal-directed movements in space or from a learned strategy to protect the affected 
      limb. In order to dissociate the two hypotheses, patients with upper-limb CRPS were 
      asked to move with their unaffected hand towards visual targets projected at 
      different positions on a horizontal semi-reflexive mirror. By means of a robotic 
      handle placed below the screen, they were asked to move a cursor, to reach and cross 
      lines at their estimated midpoint. In some of the stimulation series, the affected 
      hand was placed below the mirror so that some lines appeared projected onto that 
      hand. Vision of the hands and the robotic handle was preserved or prevented by 
      opening or closing a shutter below the mirror. Lines were displayed on the mirror 
      according to which part of the body was affected (ispi- vs. contralateral) and the 
      actual position of the affected hand (inside vs. outside the workspace). 
      Comparatively to control participants, CRPS patients generally biased their 
      estimation by bisecting the lines towards their left side, irrelative of which part 
      of the body was affected and the position of the affected hand, both in ipsi- and 
      contralateral space, with only a few exceptions. Our results are in line with 
      previous studies having described a visuospatial deficit in CRPS patients and 
      discard the explanation of observed symptoms in terms of learned nonuse strategies, 
      as only the unaffected hand was used to perform the task. It is suggested that CRPS 
      patients can display difficulties to perform tasks requesting visuo-motor 
      coordination, reflecting the complex cortical reorganization occurring in CRPS.

TI  - Diabetes in Older Adults.
BTI - Diabetes in America
CP  - CHAPTER 16
AB  - Diabetes in older adults is a significant and growing public health problem in the 
      United States. About 40% (39.5%) of the adult diabetic population is age ≥65 years. 
      Approximately 20% (21.4%) of adults age ≥65 years have a known diagnosis of 
      diabetes, and a similar proportion (16%) is unaware that they have diabetes based on 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c), fasting plasma glucose, or oral glucose tolerance 
      testing. From 1997 to 2010, the prevalence of diabetes in older adults increased by 
      62%. The geriatric diabetic population is highly heterogeneous in regard to its 
      race/ethnicity, duration of diabetes, comorbidity, and functional status, which 
      complicates the development of standard guidelines for the care of this population. 
      Diagnosed heart disease is prevalent in about one-quarter of older adults with 
      diabetes. Geriatric conditions are also highly prevalent, including chronic pain in 
      over half and at least one functional limitation in two-thirds of older adults with 
      diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of mortality and cardiovascular and 
      microvascular complications, as well as all known geriatric conditions (cognitive 
      impairment, frailty, unintentional weight loss, polypharmacy, and functional 
      impairment). The Diabetes Prevention Program showed that a lifestyle intervention 
      may be particularly effective at reducing future diabetes in older adults. Evidence 
      for the benefits of intensive glycemic control among older adults is mixed, and the 
      benefits of intensive control should be weighed carefully against the risks of 
      polypharmacy, falls, and hypoglycemia. Even less evidence is available to guide 
      efforts to prevent the geriatric conditions associated with diabetes. Routine 
      screening for geriatric conditions, including dementia, depression, and falls, as 
      well as hypoglycemia, may be especially important in older adults because of the 
      potential barrier posed by these conditions on diabetes self-management. In the 
      United States, the costs of diabetes in older adults are largely borne by Medicare, 
      the federal universal health insurance program for older adults. In 2012, the direct 
      medical costs of diabetes care for older adults were estimated to be $104 billion 
      per year largely due to hospital inpatient stays. The additional burden on society 
      of informal caregiving is also significant. The costs of diabetes care in older 
      adults are expected to triple from 2009 to 2034. Future approaches to diabetes care 
      in older adults will likely be guided by recommendations from the American Diabetes 
      Association to provide highly individualized care.

TI  - Risk Factors for Depression in Long-term Care: A Prospective Observational Cohort 
      Study.
PG  - 112-125
LID - 10.1080/07317115.2019.1635548 [doi]
AB  - Objectives: Depression among older adults in long-term care remains a problem, 
      despite the uptake of antidepressants and the development of intervention programs. 
      A better understanding of the risk factors for depression is much needed. Guided by 
      a systematic assessment of the evidence, this prospective observational cohort study 
      sought to clarify existing evidence, identify modifiable risk factors and explore 
      novel variables. Methods: Adults aged ≥65 (T1 n=147, T2 n= 81) were recruited from 
      15 long-term-care facilities in Melbourne, Australia. Cognitive impairment, 
      functional impairment, pain, sleep disturbance, social support, and 
      person-environment fit were investigated as risk factors. Outcomes were depressive 
      symptoms and indicated Major Depressive Episode. Results: Generalized Estimating 
      Equations (GEE) identified that changes in pain (b= 0.06, p <.05), sleep disturbance 
      (b= 0.02, p< .001), social support (b= -0.02, p< .001) and person-environment fit 
      (b= -0.02, p= <.01) were significantly associated with changes in depression score. 
      Conclusions: Pain, sleep disturbance, social support, and person-environment fit are 
      modifiable risk factors, making them strongly positioned to strategically inform 
      prevention and intervention strategies. Clinical Implications: Individuals with 
      clinically significant symptoms on these risk factors for depression should be 
      selected for interventions that target these risk factors. For depressed 
      individuals, psychotherapy should prioritize the potential role of these risk 
      factors. Finally, these risk factors should be used as screening and monitoring 
      variables: clinically significant changes in symptoms warrant investigation.

TI  - Tackling anxiety and depression in older people in primary care.
PG  - 17-20, 2-3
AB  - Epidemiological studies suggest that anxiety and depression are less common in older 
      than younger adults. One in ten people aged > or = 65 fulfils the diagnostic 
      criteria for at least one common mental disorder. Older depressed patients have an 
      increased risk of both cardiac and all-cause mortality. Both anxiety and depression 
      in older patients are often unrecognised and untreated, and have a poor prognosis. 
      There is a progressive decline in the prevalence of common mental disorders above 
      the age of 55. Anxiety and depression often occur together, and share many risk 
      factors. However, anxiety tends to follow threats or traumatic events, whereas 
      depression follows loss events. Chronic diseases, cognitive impairment, pain and 
      functional disability are risk factors for the onset of depression, but not anxiety. 
      Depression is between two and three times more common among those with a chronic 
      physical health problem. Even patients with major depression often remain 
      unrecognised and untreated. Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is by far the most 
      common anxiety disorder in older people but most GAD patients are not recognised in 
      primary care and only a third of them receive any form of treatment. Older patients 
      often deny feeling anxious or depressed and are more likely to present with 
      insomnia, irritability, agitation and multiple somatic complaints. GPs may 
      erroneously believe that depression is a normal reaction to the losses of old age, 
      and may be reluctant to initiate treatment. A good case can be made for replacing 
      the PHQ-9 with the 15-item version of the Geriatric Depression Scale which almost 
      entirely avoids somatic questions. This is a screening not a diagnostic tool and 
      does not evaluate symptom severity.

TI  - Interventions to optimize prescribed medicines and reduce their misuse in chronic 
      non-malignant pain: a systematic review.
PG  - 467-490
LID - 10.1007/s00228-020-03026-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Sub-optimal opioid prescribing and use is viewed as a major contributor to 
      the growing opioid crisis. This study aims to systematically review the nature, 
      process and outcomes of interventions to optimize prescribed medicines and reduce 
      their misuse in chronic non-malignant pain (CNMP) with a particular focus on 
      minimizing misuse of opiates. METHODS: A systematic review of literature was 
      undertaken. Search of literature using Medline, EMBASE and CINAHL databases from 
      2000 onwards was conducted. Screening and selection, data extraction and risk of 
      bias assessments were undertaken by two independent reviewers. Narrative synthesis 
      of the data was conducted. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies were included in the 
      review, of which three were RCTs. Interventions included clinical (e.g. urine drug 
      testing, opioid treatment contract, pill count), behavioural (e.g. electrical 
      diaries about craving), cognitive behavioural treatment and/or educational 
      interventions for patients and healthcare providers delivered as a single or as a 
      multi-component intervention. Medication optimization outcomes included aspects of 
      misuse, abuse, aberrant drug behaviour, adherence and non-adherence. Although all 
      evaluations showed improvement in medication optimization outcomes, multi-component 
      interventions were more likely to consider and to have shown improvement in clinical 
      outcomes such as pain intensity, quality of life, psychological states and 
      functional improvement compared to single-component interventions. CONCLUSIONS: A 
      well-structured CNMP management programme to promote medicines optimization should 
      include multi-component interventions delivered by a multidisciplinary team of 
      healthcare professionals and target both healthcare professionals and patients. 
      There was heterogeneity in definitions applied and interventions evaluated. There is 
      a need for the development of clear and consistent terminology and measurement 
      criteria to facilitate better comparisons of research evidence.

TI  - Recall Bias in Patients with Chronic Low Back Pain: Individual Pain Response 
      Patterns Are More Important Than Pain Itself!
PG  - 12-20
LID - 10.1007/s12529-015-9499-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients' cognitive processing of pain-related information as well as 
      their cognitive, affective and behavioral response pattern when experiencing pain in 
      daily life has been shown to be associated with poorer prognosis in low back pain. 
      However, the relationship between specific cognitive processes such as recall of 
      pain-related material and individual pain responses remains unknown. PURPOSE: The 
      present study sought to investigate recall bias in patients with chronic low back 
      pain (CLBP) compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, it was aimed to investigate 
      the impact of patients' individual pain-related responses on recall bias, comparing 
      fear-avoidance response (FAR), endurance response (ER) and adaptive response (AR) 
      patterns. METHOD: Thirty-one CLBP patients and 31 controls were tested on a free 
      recall task with three word lists comprising pain words and neutral words. Further, 
      the CLBP group was classified into patients with a FAR, ER and AR pattern, using a 
      short screening including the Avoidance-Endurance Questionnaire (AEQ). Group 
      differences with pain status (CLBP vs. healthy) and AEQ responses (FAR, ER, AR) as 
      between-group factors, word type (pain vs. neutral) as within-group factor and free 
      recall as dependent variable were analysed by means of repeated-measures analysis of 
      (co-) variance. RESULTS: Results revealed different pain processing of pain words 
      between FAR and ER patterns, whereas CLBP patients as a whole did not differ from 
      the healthy controls. FAR patients displayed significantly less recall than ER 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Recall biases in CLBP patients are not only a result of 
      experiencing pain but also effected by patients' pain response pattern with respect 
      to fear-avoidance versus endurance.

TI  - Operationalisation of a biopsychosocial approach for the non-pharmacological 
      management of patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain in low- and middle-income 
      countries: A systematic review.
PG  - 227-244
LID - 10.1002/msc.1462 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a major health concern. The 
      biopsychosocial approach is an evidence-based approach recommended for managing 
      chronic musculoskeletal pain. However, the evidence for this approach is largely 
      reported from high-income countries; therefore, it is important to ascertain how 
      biopsychosocial approaches are operationalised in low- and middle-income countries 
      to inform practice. AIM: To examine the evidence for the operationalization of 
      biopsychosocial interventions in managing patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain 
      in low-and middle-income countries. METHODS: The search included studies published 
      in English from 2008 to September 2019 in: Cochrane library, OVID, CINAHL, Scopus, 
      PUBMED, Web of Science, and SportDiscus. Randomised and non-randomised trials using 
      a biopsychosocial intervention were considered. The review team developed a search 
      strategy; two independent reviewers screened and assessed results for quality. 
      RESULTS: Sixteen studies were included (n = 996) with mainly low back pain 
      populations (n = 11 studies). Others were osteoarthritis (n = 1) and other 
      musculoskeletal pain (n = 4). The majority (n = 12) of studies attained fair to poor 
      quality, three had good quality, one scored excellent quality. Interventions applied 
      biopsychosocial principles such as cognitive functional therapy, and graded 
      activity, delivered by healthcare professionals such as physiotherapists and 
      doctors. However, most results provided insufficient information regarding 
      healthcare professionals' capacity to deliver interventions, lack of information 
      regarding intervention delivery and training of healthcare professionals. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the potential for delivering biopsychosocial 
      interventions in low- and middle-income countries; however, future research should 
      consider robust methodological approaches with clear details to achieve high-quality 
      trials.

TI  - Tourniquet use for knee replacement surgery.
PG  - CD012874
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD012874.pub2 [doi]
LID - CD012874
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many surgeons prefer to perform total knee replacement surgery with the 
      aid of a tourniquet. A tourniquet is an occlusive device that restricts distal blood 
      flow to help create a bloodless field during the procedure. A tourniquet may be 
      associated with increased risk of pain and complications. OBJECTIVES: To determine 
      the benefits and harms of tourniquet use in knee replacement surgery. SEARCH 
      METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled 
      Trials (CENTRAL) up to 26 March 2020. We searched clinicaltrials.gov, the World 
      Health Organization trials portal, and several international registries and joint 
      registries up to March 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled 
      trials (RCTs) comparing knee replacement with use of a tourniquet versus without use 
      of a tourniquet and non-randomised studies with more than 1000 participants. Major 
      outcomes included pain, function, global assessment of success, health-related 
      quality of life, serious adverse events (including venous thromboembolism, 
      infection, re-operation, and mortality), cognitive function, and survival of the 
      implant. Minor outcomes included blood loss, economic outcomes, implant stability, 
      and adverse events. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors screened 
      abstracts and full texts, extracted data, performed risk of bias assessments, and 
      assessed the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: We 
      included 41 RCTs with 2819 participants. Trials included from 20 to 199 
      participants. Mean age ranged between 58 and 84 years. More than half of the RCTs 
      had unclear risk of selection bias and unclear risk of performance and detection 
      bias due to absence of blinding of participants and surgeons. Major outcomes Pain: 
      at postoperative day 1, pain (on a scale from zero to 10, with higher scores 
      indicating worse pain) was ranked at 4.56 points after surgery without a tourniquet 
      and at 1.25 points (MD) higher (95% CI 0.32 higher to 2.19 higher) with a tourniquet 
      (8 studies; 577 participants), for an absolute difference of 12.5% higher pain 
      scores (95% CI 3.2% higher to 21.9% higher) and a relative difference of 19% higher 
      pain scores (95% CI 3.4% higher to 49% higher) with a tourniquet. Evidence for these 
      findings was of moderate certainty, downgraded due to risk of bias. Knee replacement 
      with a tourniquet probably led to higher postoperative pain scores at day 1, 
      although this difference may or may not be noticeable to patients (based on a 
      minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.0). Function: at 12 months, 
      tourniquet use probably makes little or no difference to function, based on an MCID 
      of 5.3 for Knee Society Score (KSS) and 5.0 for Oxford Knee Score (OKS). Mean 
      function (on a scale from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better outcomes) 
      was 90.03 points after surgery without a tourniquet and was 0.29 points worse (95% 
      CI 1.06 worse to 0.48 better) on a 0 to 100 scale, absolute difference was 0.29% 
      worse (1.06% worse to 0.48% better), with a tourniquet (5 studies; 611 
      participants). This evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of 
      bias. Global assessment of success: low-certainty evidence (downgraded due to bias 
      and imprecision) indicates that tourniquet use may have little or no effect on 
      success. At six months, 47 of 50 (or 940 per 1000) reported overall successful 
      treatment after surgery without a tourniquet and 47 of 50 (or 940 per 1000) with a 
      tourniquet (risk ratio (RR) 1.0, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.10) based on one study with 100 
      participants. Health-related quality of life: at six months, tourniquet may have 
      little or no effect on quality of life. The 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) score 
      (mental component from zero to 100 (100 is best)) was 54.64 after surgery without a 
      tourniquet and 1.53 (MD) better (95% CI 0.85 worse to 3.91 better) with a tourniquet 
      (1 study; 199 participants); absolute difference was 1.53% better (0.85% worse to 
      3.91% better). Evidence was of low certainty, downgraded due to risk of bias and 
      small number of participants. Serious adverse events: the risk of serious adverse 
      events was probably higher with tourniquet; 26 of 898 (29 per 1000) reported events 
      following surgery without a tourniquet compared to 53 of 901 (59 per 1000) with a 
      tourniquet (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.73) in 21 studies (1799 participants). 
      Twenty-nine more per 1000 patients (95% CI 3 to 50 more per 1000 patients) had a 
      serious adverse event with a tourniquet. Forty-eight (95% CI 20 to 345) participants 
      would need to have surgery without a tourniquet to avoid one serious adverse event. 
      This evidence was downgraded to moderate certainty due to risk of bias. Cognitive 
      function: one study reported cognitive function as an outcome; however the data were 
      incompletely reported and could not be extracted for analysis. Survival of implant: 
      it is uncertain if tourniquet has an effect on implant survival due to very low 
      certainty evidence (downgraded for bias, and twice due to very low event rates); 2 
      of 107 (19 per 1000) required revision surgery in the surgery with a tourniquet 
      group compared to 1 of 107 (9 per 1000) without a tourniquet group at up to two 
      years' follow-up (RR 1.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 8.92). This equates to a 0.4% (0.7% lower 
      to 7% more) increased absolute risk in surgery with a tourniquet. AUTHORS' 
      CONCLUSIONS: Moderate certainty evidence shows that knee replacement surgery with a 
      tourniquet is probably associated with an increased risk of serious adverse events. 
      Surgery with a tourniquet is also probably associated with higher postoperative 
      pain, although this difference may or may not be noticeable to patients. Surgery 
      with a tourniquet does not appear to confer any clinically meaningful benefit on 
      function, treatment success or quality of life. Further research is required to 
      explore the effects of tourniquet use on cognitive function and implant survival, to 
      identify any additional harms or benefits. If a tourniquet continues to be used in 
      knee replacement surgery, patients should be informed about the potential increased 
      risk of serious adverse events and postoperative pain.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a common nonmotor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). The 
      pathophysiology of pain in PD is not well understood. Pain characteristics have 
      rarely been studied in atypical parkinsonian disorders such as Multiple System 
      Atrophy (MSA) and Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed 
      to evaluate pain intensity, location, and associated symptoms in atypical 
      parkinsonian disorders compared to PD. METHODS: Twenty-one patients with MSA, 16 
      patients with PSP, and 65 patients with PD were screened for pain using question 1.9 
      of the MDS-UPDRS. Pain intensity was quantified using the short form McGill Pain 
      Questionnaire (SFMPQ). Pain locations were documented. Motor disability was measured 
      using UPDRS-III. Affective symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: Pain was significantly more common and more severe 
      in PD and MSA compared to PSP (P < 0.01). Pain locations were similar with limb pain 
      being the most common followed by neck and back pain. Pain intensity correlated with 
      HADS scores but not motor severity. CONCLUSIONS: Pain is more common and more 
      intense in PD and MSA than PSP. Differences in distribution of neurodegenerative 
      pathologies may underlie these differential pain profiles.

BTI - Evidence Map of Tai Chi
AB  - This evidence map provides an overview of Tai Chi research and describes its volume 
      and focus. It combines a systematic review of systematic reviews with a scoping 
      review for the VA priority areas pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and fall 
      prevention. The evidence map summarizes patient outcomes reported in reviews of 
      studies in patients practicing Tai Chi for health-related indications. We searched 
      PubMed, DARE, the Cochrane Library of Systematic Reviews, the Campbell Collaboration 
      database, AMED, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, and PROSPERO; screened 
      reviews of reviews; and consulted with topic experts. We used a bubble plot to 
      graphically display the research field and summarized results narratively in an 
      executive summary. Tai Chi has been investigated as a treatment for a number of 
      clinical indications. The systematic review identified 107 systematic reviews. 
      Reviews addressing general health effects, psychological wellbeing, or interventions 
      in older adults included between 31 and 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The 
      topic areas balance, hypertension, falls, quality of life, cognitive performance, 
      and vestibulopathy have also been the focus of research; included reviews identified 
      10 or more pertinent RCTs per topic. Statistically significant effects across 
      existing studies were reported for hypertension, falls outside of institutions, 
      cognitive performance, osteoarthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pain, 
      balance confidence, depression, and muscle strength. However, review authors 
      cautioned that firm conclusions cannot be drawn due to methodological limitations in 
      the original studies and/or an insufficient number of research studies.

TI  - painPREDICT: first interim data from the development of a new patient-reported pain 
      questionnaire to predict treatment response using sensory symptom profiles.
PG  - 1177-1185
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2018.1562687 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Sensory symptom patterns may be useful for predicting treatment response, 
      and, thus, improve individual therapy in patients suffering from neuropathic pain 
      (NeP). Existing screening questionnaires focus predominately on neuropathic 
      mechanisms without consideration of nociceptive mechanisms or mixed pain states. 
      This study aimed to develop a new questionnaire, painPREDICT, using a wide set of 
      patient-reported descriptors potentially associated with neuropathic and nociceptive 
      pain mechanisms, and to explore sensory symptom patterns. Methods: PainPREDICT was 
      constructed based on exploratory (n = 27 patients) and cognitive debriefing 
      interviews (n = 49 patients and nine physicians), across five NeP conditions. The 
      pilot questionnaire was then administered in a non-interventional, cross-sectional, 
      multi-center study to 840 pain patients across the US and Germany. The 
      identification of a sensory symptom pattern was based on hybrid clustering resulting 
      from items standardization followed by principal component analysis. Results: The 
      final questionnaire included 20 items covering: pain intensity, location of pain, 
      course of pain, and sensory symptoms. Most patients participating in the 
      cross-sectional study suffered either from painful diabetic polyneuropathy (n = 330) 
      or radiculopathy (n = 349), fewer from central pain (n = 61) or other types of NeP 
      (n = 100). The hybrid clustering of the new questionnaire data identified three 
      different characteristic sensory symptom profiles in patients with NeP: "Irritable 
      nociceptors", "deafferentation pain", and "pain attacks with nociceptive component". 
      Although some differences in the distribution of the sensory profiles were found, 
      all profiles were represented in all NeP etiology groups. Conclusions: This study 
      set the ground of painPREDICT and showed promising results for its use to categorize 
      patients according to sensory symptom patterns.

TI  - Targeting Nitric Oxide Production in Microglia with Novel Imidazodiazepines for 
      Nonsedative Pain Treatment.
PG  - 2019-2030
LID - 10.1021/acschemneuro.0c00324 [doi]
AB  - The goal of this research is the identification of new treatments for neuropathic 
      pain. We characterized the GABAergic system of immortalized mouse and human 
      microglia using electrophysiology and qRT-PCR. Cells from both species exhibited 
      membrane current changes in response to γ-aminobutyric acid, with an EC(50) of 260 
      and 1940 nM, respectively. Human microglia expressed high levels of the 
      γ-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABA(A)R) α(3) subunit, which can assemble with 
      β(1) and γ(2)/δ subunits to form functional GABA(A)Rs. Mouse microglia contained 
      α(2), α(3), and α(5), in addition to β(1-3), γ(1-2), and δ, mRNA, enabling a more 
      diverse array of GABA(A)Rs than human microglia. Benzodiazepines are 
      well-established modulators of GABA(A)R activity, prompting a screen of a library of 
      diverse benzodiazepines in microglia for cellular effects. Several active compounds 
      were identified by reduction of nitric oxide (NO) in interferon gamma and 
      lipopolysaccharide activated microglia. However, further investigation with GABA(A)R 
      antagonists flumazenil, picrotoxin, and bicuculline demonstrated that GABA(A)Rs were 
      not linked to the NO response. A screen of 48 receptors identified the κ-opioid 
      receptor and to a lesser extent the μ-opioid receptor as molecular targets, with 
      opioid receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine reversing benzodiazepine induced 
      reduction of microglial NO. Functional assays identified the downregulation of 
      inducible NO synthase as the mode of action of imidazodiazepines MP-IV-010 and 
      GL-IV-03. Like other κ-opioid receptor agonists, GL-IV-03 reduced the agitation 
      response in both phases of the formalin nociception test. However, unlike other 
      κ-opioid receptor agonists, MP-IV-010 and GL-IV-03 did not impair sensorimotor 
      coordination in mice. Thus, MP-IV-010 and GL-IV-03 represent a new class of 
      nonsedative drug candidates for inflammatory pain.

TI  - Screening for Adult ADHD in Patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome.
PG  - 1825-1831
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnx275 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a common chronic pain disorder associated 
      with altered activity of neurotransmitters involved in pain sensitivity such as 
      dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline. FMS may significantly impact an individual's 
      functioning due to the presence of chronic pain, fatigue, and cognitive impairment. 
      Dyscognition may be more disabling than the chronic pain but is mostly 
      under-recognized. This study aimed to assess the potential co-occurrence of FMS and 
      adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), a chronic neurodevelopmental 
      disorder also associated with impaired cognition and dopaminergic function. METHODS: 
      In a cross-sectional observational study, 123 previously confirmed FMS patients were 
      screened for adult ADHD using the World Health Organization Adult ADHD Self Report 
      scale v1.1. The Revised Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ-R) was used to assess 
      the impact of FMS. Cognitive assessment was based on self-report in accordance with 
      the 2011 modified American College of Rheumatology criteria and the FIQ-R, 
      respectively. RESULTS: Of the 123 participants, 44.72% (N = 55) screened positive 
      for adult ADHD. Participants with both FMS and a positive adult ADHD screening test 
      scored higher on the FIQ-R score (64.74, SD = 17.66, vs 54.10, SD = 17.10). 
      Self-reported cognitive impairment was rated higher in the combined group (odds 
      ratio = 10.61, 95% confidence interval; 3.77-29.86, P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These 
      results indicate that the co-occurrence of adult ADHD in FMS may be highly prevalent 
      and may also significantly impact the morbidity of FMS. Patients with FMS should be 
      assessed for the presence of adult ADHD.

      prospective cohort study.
PG  - 2135-2141
LID - 10.1111/jgs.12554 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the association between self-reported noncancer pain and 
      5-year mortality. DESIGN: Cohort. SETTING: Community-dwelling older adults. 
      PARTICIPANTS: Canadian Study of Health and Aging 1996 wave. MEASUREMENTS: Registrar 
      of Vital Statistics-established 5-year mortality. Noncancer pain was assessed using 
      the 5-point verbal descriptor scale, dichotomized into no or very mild versus 
      moderate, severe, or very severe pain. Frailty was the accumulation of health 
      deficits. Cognitive status (Modified Mini-Mental State Examination) and depressed 
      mood (five-item mental health screening questionnaire) were also assessed. 
      Multivariable logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards were used to analyze 
      the relationship between pain and 5-year mortality. RESULTS: Of 5,703 participants, 
      4,694 (82.3%) had complete data for analysis; 1,663 of these (35.4%) reported 
      moderate, severe, or very severe pain, and 1,343 (28.6%) had died at 5-year 
      follow-up. Four hundred ninety-six of those who died (29.8%) reported moderate, 
      severe, or very severe pain and 847 (27.9%) no or very mild pain. Multivariate 
      logistic analysis found that individuals with moderate, severe, or very severe pain 
      had lower odds of 5-year mortality than those with no or very mild pain (odds 
      ratio=0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.66-0.92; P<.001). The risk of death was 
      lower in persons reporting moderate or greater pain than in those with no or very 
      mild pain (HR=0.85, 95% CI=0.75-0.96; P=.01). An interaction between pain and sex 
      explained this effect. Men with pain were not significantly more likely than men 
      without pain to die (HR=1.00, 95% CI=0.84-1.19; P=.99), whereas women without pain 
      (HR=0.54, 95% CI=0.47-0.63; P<0.01) and women with pain (HR=0.40; CI=0.33-0.47; 
      P<.01) had less risk of death than men without and with pain, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: Older women with pain were less likely to die within 5 years than older 
      women without pain, men in pain, or men without pain.

TI  - Tapering off long-term opioid therapy in chronic non-cancer pain patients: A 
      randomized clinical trial.
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1241 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The indications for initiating long-term opioid treatment (L-TOT) for 
      chronic non-cancer pain (CNCP) are often unclear and associated with problematic 
      use. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of stabilizing opioid therapy 
      followed by a sequential opioid tapering off program in CNCP patients. METHODS: A 
      randomized clinical trial with a medications stabilization period (Phase 1) was 
      followed by an opioid tapering off program (Phase 2). In Phase 2, patients were 
      randomized to Control Group (stable treatment) or Taper off Group (sequential opioid 
      dose reduction) and assessed at baseline, after stabilization and up to 6 months. 
      Primary outcomes: measures of cognitive function; secondary outcomes: pain, sleep, 
      rest, quality of life, depression, anxiety, opioid misuse and opioid withdrawal 
      symptoms. RESULTS: In all, 274 patients were screened; 75 were included, out of 
      which 40 dropped out before Phase 2. Those who succeeded Phase 1 (n = 35) had 
      weak/moderate improvements of psychomotor function (p = 0.020), sleeping hours 
      (p = 0.031), opioid withdrawal symptoms (p = 0.019), measures of quality of life 
      (p ≤ 0.043) and opioid misuse scores (p = 0.003). In Phase 2, patients in Taper off 
      Group (n = 15) experienced stable pain intensity and felt significantly more rested 
      at third assessment than the Control Group (n = 20). CONCLUSIONS: The opioid 
      tapering off program was not successful due to the vast number of dropouts. Phase 1 
      was associated with weak to moderate improvements on psychomotor function, sleeping, 
      opioid withdrawal symptoms, quality of life and reduced risk of opioid misuse. In 
      the intervention group of Phase 2, pain intensity was stable and patients felt more 
      rested. SIGNIFICANCE: This trial showed that sequential tapering off L-TOT in CNCP 
      patients may be an unfeasible approach. However, improvements after opioid treatment 
      stabilization were achieved and stable pain intensity in those tapered off may 
      encourage the development of more refined programs.

TI  - Anxiety Sensitivity as a Risk Indicator for Anxiety, Depression, and Headache 
      Severity in Women With Migraine.
PG  - 1212-1220
LID - 10.1111/head.13568 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary aim of this exploratory study was to assess the relationship 
      between anxiety sensitivity and emotional disorders, migraine characteristics, and 
      migraine-related fear and avoidance behaviors in women with probable migraine. 
      BACKGROUND: Anxiety and depressive disorders are the most frequent comorbid 
      psychiatric conditions in migraine, particularly in women; however, the underlying 
      reasons for these comorbidities are uncertain. Anxiety sensitivity, the tendency to 
      catastrophically appraise anxiety and bodily sensations in terms of their physical, 
      social, or cognitive consequences, is a psychological factor that may contribute to 
      the comorbidity of anxiety and depressive disorders and migraine. It was 
      hypothesized that anxiety sensitivity would be associated with greater migraine 
      severity and psychiatric symptoms. METHOD: Participants were women (n = 100) who 
      screened positive for migraine on the validated IDMigraine Screener participated in 
      an anonymous single-session online survey-based study on migraine. The Anxiety 
      Sensitivity Index-3 total and subscales scores were used to assess anxiety 
      sensitivity. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed with the brief Patient 
      Health Questionnaire. RESULTS: On average, anxiety sensitivity was clinically 
      elevated (mean ± SD: 24.0 ± 15.2). Anxiety sensitivity cognitive and social concerns 
      were most strongly correlated with severity of anxiety (r's = .38-.46) and 
      depressive symptoms (r = .35-.39, P's < .001), and all anxiety sensitivity facets 
      were related to fear of head pain (r's = .35-.38, P's < .001). Anxiety sensitivity 
      cognitive concern facet was uniquely related to headache patterns, including longer 
      migraine attack duration (r = .22, P = .029) and pain intensity (r = .24, P = .029), 
      pain-related avoidance, including avoiding movement and more frequent misuse of 
      prescribed or non-prescribed pain medication (r's = .20-.21, P's < .01). 
      CONCLUSIONS: These novel findings indicate that anxiety sensitivity, specifically 
      fearful appraisal of bodily sensations, are linked to both psychiatric symptoms and 
      migraine severity in women. In this cross-sectional study, causal sequence cannot be 
      determined. If anxiety sensitivity leads to more severe pain and psychiatric 
      distress, targeting anxiety sensitivity could lead to better headache outcomes.

TI  - Patient-Centered Outcomes From Multiparametric MRI and MRI-Guided Biopsy for 
      Prostate Cancer: A Systematic Review.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify and characterize patient-centered outcomes (PCOs) relating to 
      multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) and MRI-guided biopsy as diagnostic tests for possible 
      prostate cancer. METHODS: Medline via OVID, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and the Cochrane 
      Central register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) were searched for relevant articles. 
      Hand searching of reference lists and snowballing techniques were performed. Studies 
      of mpMRI and MRI-guided biopsy that measured any PCO were included. There were no 
      restrictions placed on year of publication, language, or country for study 
      inclusion. All database search hits were screened independently by two reviewers, 
      and data were extracted using a standardized form. RESULTS: Overall, 2,762 database 
      search hits were screened based on title and abstract. Of these, 222 full-text 
      articles were assessed, and 10 studies met the inclusion criteria. There were 2,192 
      participants featured in the included studies, all of which were conducted in 
      high-income countries. Nineteen different PCOs were measured, with a median of four 
      PCOs per study (range 1-11). Urethral bleeding, pain, and urinary tract infection 
      were the most common outcomes measured. In the four studies that compared mpMRI or 
      MRI-guided biopsy to transrectal ultrasound biopsy, most adverse outcomes occurred 
      less frequently in MRI-related tests. These four studies were assessed as having a 
      low risk of bias. DISCUSSION: PCOs measured in studies of mpMRI or MRI-guided biopsy 
      thus far have mostly been physical outcomes, with some evidence that MRI tests are 
      associated with less frequent adverse outcomes compared with transrectal ultrasound 
      biopsy. There was very little evidence for the effect of mpMRI and MRI-guided biopsy 
      on emotional, cognitive, social, or behavioral outcomes.

TI  - Exploring the effects of visual perspective on the ERP components of empathy for 
      pain.
PG  - 186-198
LID - 10.1080/17470919.2019.1674686 [doi]
AB  - Previous neurophysiological research suggests that there are event-related potential 
      (ERP) components associated with empathy for pain: an early affective component (N2) 
      and two late cognitive components (P3/LPP). The current study investigated whether 
      and how the visual perspective from which a painful event is observed affects these 
      ERP components. Participants viewed images of hands in pain vs. not in pain from a 
      first-person or third-person perspective. We found that visual perspective 
      influences both the early and late components. In the early component (N2), there 
      was a larger mean amplitude during observation of pain vs no-pain exclusively when 
      images were shown from a first-person perspective. We suggest that this effect may 
      be driven by misattributing the on-screen hand to oneself. For the late component 
      (P3), we found a larger effect of pain on mean amplitudes in response to 
      third-person relative to first-person images. We speculate that the P3 may reflect a 
      later process that enables effective recognition of others' pain in the absence of 
      misattribution. We discuss our results in relation to self- vs other-related 
      processing by questioning whether these ERP components are truly indexing empathy 
      (an other-directed process) or a simple misattribution of another's pain as one's 
      own (a self-directed process).

TI  - Preoperative Frailty Predicts Postoperative Neurocognitive Disorders After Total Hip 
      Joint Replacement Surgery.
PG  - 1582-1588
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000004893 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frailty is a reduced capacity to recover from a physiologically 
      stressful event. It is well established that preoperative frailty is associated with 
      poor postoperative outcomes, but it is unclear if this includes cognitive decline 
      following anesthesia and surgery. This retrospective observational study was a 
      secondary analysis of data from a previous study (the Anaesthesia, Cognition, 
      Evaluation [ACE] study). We aimed to identify if preoperative frailty or prefrailty 
      is associated with preoperative and postoperative neurocognitive disorders or 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction. METHODS: The ACE study enrolled 300 
      participants aged ≥60 scheduled for elective total hip joint replacement and who 
      underwent a full neuropsychological assessment at baseline and 3 and 12 months 
      postoperatively. We applied patient data to 2 frailty models; both were based on an 
      accumulation of deficits score: the reported Edmonton frail scale (REFS) and the 
      comprehensive geriatric assessment-frailty index (CGA-FI) based on the comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment. We calculated these 2 scores using baseline data collected 
      from the medical history, demographic and clinical data as well as self-reported 
      questionnaires. Some items on the REFS (3 of 18 or 17%) and the CGA-FI (37 of 51 or 
      27%) did not have an equivalent item in the ACE data. RESULTS: The mean age 
      (standard deviation [SD]) was 70.1 years (6.6) with more women (197 [66%]). Using 
      the REFS model, 40 of 300 (13.3%) patients were classified as vulnerable, mild, or 
      moderately frail. Using the CGA-FI model, 69 of 300 (23%) were classified as 
      intermediate or high frailty. The REFS and the CGA-FI were strongly correlated (r = 
      0.75; P < .01) with 34 of 300 (11%) meeting criteria for frailty by both the REFS 
      and the CGA-FI.Frailty or prefrailty was associated with cognitive decline at 3 and 
      12 months using the REFS (odds ratio [OR], 1.51, 95% confidence interval [CI], 
      1.02-2.23 and OR, 2.00, 95% CI, 1.26-3.17, respectively) after adjusting for 
      baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), smoking, hypertension, diabetes, 
      history of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and estimated intelligence quotient 
      (IQ). Age did not modify this association. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, 
      3-month cognitive decline was no longer significantly associated with baseline 
      frailty. CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective analysis demonstrates an association 
      between baseline frailty and postoperative neurocognitive disorders, particularly 
      using the more extensive REFS scoring method. This supports preoperative screening 
      for frailty to risk-stratify patients, and identify and implement preventive 
      strategies and to improve postoperative outcomes for older individuals.

AB  - Claims are made for the validity of some self-report pain scales for 3- and 
      4-year-old children, but little is known about their ability to use such tools. This 
      systematic review identified self-report pain intensity measures used with 3- and/or 
      4- year-old participants (3-4yo) and considered their reliability and validity 
      within this age span. The search protocol identified research articles that included 
      3-4yo, reported use of any pain scale, and included self-reported pain intensity 
      ratings. A total of 1,590 articles were screened and 617 articles met inclusion 
      criteria. Of the included studies, 98% aggregated self-report data for 3-4yo with 
      data for older children, leading to overestimates of the reliability and validity of 
      self-report in the younger age group. In the 14 studies that provided nonaggregated 
      data for 3-4yo, there was no evidence for 3-year-old and weak evidence for 
      4-year-old children being able to use published self-report pain intensity tools in 
      a valid or reliable way. Preschool-age children have been reported to do better with 
      fewer than the 6 response options offered on published faces scales. Simplified 
      tools are being developed for young children; however, more research is needed 
      before these are adopted. PERSPECTIVE: Some self-report pain scales have been 
      promoted for use with 3- and 4-year-old children, but this is on the basis of 
      studies that aggregated data for younger and older children, resulting in 
      overestimates of reliability and validity for the preschool-age children. Scales 
      with fewer response options show promise, at least for 4-year-old children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is prevalent in the developed world. Favourable 
      survival rates highlight the need to better understand CRC survivors' experiences of 
      long-term impacts of treatment, which can in turn inform decision making. This 
      systematic review aimed to identify and synthesise CRC survivors' experiences of 
      long-term impacts on health-related quality of life. METHODS: We searched Medline, 
      Embase and PsychINFO from inception to January 2019. Qualitative studies describing 
      CRC survivors' experiences at least 1-year post-treatment were included. Study 
      eligibility, quality assessment (COREQ guidelines), and data synthesis was performed 
      independently by two reviewers and discussed with the study team. RESULTS: Of 1363 
      papers retrieved, 20 reporting 15 studies met eligibility. Thematic synthesis 
      produced 12 themes: symptoms, physical, social, psychological and sexual 
      functioning, impact on relationships, informal care needs provided by family/friend, 
      supportive care needs provided by healthcare professional, health care experiences, 
      health behaviour, financial toxicity and occupational experiences. Stoma problems 
      (e.g. leakage, skin irritation) were common in ostomates. Survivors with no/reversed 
      stoma experienced unexpected, long-term altered and unpredictable bowel functioning. 
      Survivors often regulated timing, amount and foods consumed to manage bowel 
      functioning. Less common symptoms included fatigue, impaired sleep and anal pain. 
      Stoma problems and altered bowel functioning impaired survivors' physical, social, 
      sexual and psychological functioning. Cognitive functioning and heredity issues were 
      not reported in any paper. CONCLUSION: CRC survivors experience ongoing symptoms and 
      functioning impairments more than 1-year post-treatment completion. Many survivors 
      find their own ways to manage symptoms rather than seek professional help. Follow-up 
      care for CRC survivors should integrate screening for long-term effects and provide 
      targeted supportive care.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify baseline predictors of 
      disability and absenteeism in workers with a history of non-specific low back pain 
      (LBP). METHODS: One hundred workers with a history of non-specific LBP participated 
      in three evaluations (baseline, 7 and 15 months follow-up). Current and past history 
      of LBP, clinical pain intensity, disability, absenteeism, fear-avoidance beliefs, 
      pain catastrophizing, pain hypervigilance, work satisfaction and patient 
      stratification based on "risk of poor clinical outcome assessment" (RPCO) were 
      evaluated using questionnaires and interviews. In addition, cutaneous heat pain 
      thresholds, cutaneous heat pain tolerance thresholds, conditioned pain modulation 
      (CPM), trunk kinematics and muscle activity were measured during each evaluation. 
      Logistic regression models were used to determine predictors of LBP disability and 
      absenteeism at 15-months. RESULTS: Sixty-eight workers returned for the 15-month 
      follow-up and among this sample, 49% reported disability and 16% reported 
      absenteeism at follow-up. Baseline clinical pain intensity predicted disability 
      (OR = 1.08, 95%CI: 1.03-1.13) at 15-month while work satisfaction (OR = 0.93, 95%CI: 
      0.87-0.99) and RPCO (OR = 1.51, 95%CI: 1.05-2.16) predicted absenteeism. These 
      results remained significant after adjustments for age, gender as well as type of 
      work and intervention. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the importance of clinical 
      pain and psychological factors in the prediction and potentially the prevention of 
      future disability. Screening tools assessing these risk factors can be useful to 
      evaluate workers with past history of low back pain.

TI  - Comparing self-harming intentions underlying eating disordered behaviors and NSSI: 
      Evidence that distinctions are less clear than assumed.
PG  - 564-575
LID - 10.1002/eat.23041 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Eating disordered (ED) behaviors (i.e., binge eating, compensatory 
      behaviors, restrictive eating) and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI; intentional and 
      nonsuicidal self-harm) are highly comorbid and share several similarities, including 
      consequent pain and physical damage. However, whereas NSSI is considered direct 
      self-harm, ED behaviors are considered indirect self-harm. These distinctions stem 
      from theoretical understanding that NSSI is enacted to cause physical harm in the 
      moment, whereas ED behaviors are enacted for other reasons, with consequent physical 
      harm occurring downstream of the behaviors. We sought to build on these 
      theoretically informed classifications by assessing a range of self-harming 
      intentions across NSSI and ED behaviors. METHOD: Study recruitment was conducted via 
      online forums. After screening for inclusion criteria, 151 adults reported on their 
      intent to and knowledge of causing physical harm in the short- and long-term and 
      suicide and death related cognitions and intentions when engaging in NSSI and 
      specific ED behaviors. RESULTS: Participants reported engaging in ED and NSSI 
      behaviors with intent to hurt themselves physically in the moment and long-term, 
      alongside thoughts of suicide, and with some hope and knowledge of dying sooner due 
      to these behaviors. Distinctions across behaviors also emerged. Participants 
      reported greater intent to cause physical harm in the moment via NSSI and in the 
      long-run via restrictive eating. NSSI and restrictive eating were associated with 
      stronger endorsement of most suicide and death-related intentions than binge eating 
      or compensatory behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Findings shed light on classification of 
      self-harming behaviors, casting doubt that firm boundaries differentiate direct and 
      indirectly self-harming behaviors.

TI  - Prevalence of cognitive impairment using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      questionnaire among patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: a cross-sectional 
      study at two tertiary centres in Malaysia.
PG  - 854-861
LID - 10.1177/0961203319852153 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive impairment is a common neuropsychiatric manifestation of 
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, it is not routinely assessed for 
      despite its high prevalence and significant disease burden. AIMS: This study aimed 
      to determine the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using the Montreal 
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and its associated factors among patients diagnosed with 
      SLE in Malaysia. METHODS: A total of 200 SLE patients were recruited prospectively 
      from the outpatient clinics of two tertiary hospitals in Malaysia. Standardized 
      clinical interview was utilized to obtain information on socio-demographic 
      characteristics. All patients were then assessed using the MoCA questionnaire for 
      presence of cognitive impairment; the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) for 
      presence of depressive symptoms; and the Wong-Baker Faces Pain Scale (WBFPS) for 
      severity of pain. The evaluation of disease activity and severity were performed by 
      the treating rheumatologists and nephrologists using the Systemic Lupus 
      Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) and Systemic Lupus International 
      Collaborating Clinics Damage Index (SLICC DI). RESULTS: The prevalence of MCI was 
      35%. The significant associated factors from the bivariate analysis were male gender 
      (p = 0.04), educational level (p = 0.00), WBFPS score (p = 0.035) and 
      anticardiolipin IgM (p = 0.01). Further analysis using logistic regression model 
      found that male gender (OR = 7.43, 95% confidence interval 1.06-52.06, p = 0.04), 
      lower educational level (OR = 4.4, 95% confidence interval 1.47-13.21, p = 0.01) and 
      presence of anticardiolipin IgM (OR = 6.81, 95% confidence interval 1.45-32.01, 
      p = 0.031) were associated with impaired MoCA scores. Also, increasing pain scores 
      increased the risk of patients being affected by cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: 
      Over one-third of patients with SLE in our cohort were found to have MCI. Risk 
      factors included male gender, lower educational level, higher pain score and 
      presence of anticardiolipin IgM. Physicians are encouraged to perform routine 
      screening to detect cognitive dysfunction in patients with SLE in their clinical 
      practice as part of a more comprehensive management.

PG  - 108-118

AB  - To establish the experts consensus on the management of delirium in critically ill 
      patients. A special committee was set up by 15 experts from the Chinese Critical 
      Hypothermia-Sedation Therapy Study Group. Each statement was assessed based on the 
      GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) 
      principle. Then the Delphi method was adopted by 36 experts to reassess all the 
      statements. (1) Delirium is not only a mental change, but also a clinical syndrome 
      with multiple pathophysiological changes. (2) Delirium is a form of disturbance of 
      consciousness and a manifestation of abnormal brain function. (3) Pain is a common 
      cause of delirium in critically ill patients. Analgesia can reduce the occurrence 
      and development of delirium. (4) Anxiety or depression are important factors for 
      delirium in critically ill patients. (5) The correlation between sedative and 
      analgesic drugs and delirium is uncertain. (6) Pay attention to the relationship 
      between delirium and withdrawal reactions. (7) Pay attention to the relationship 
      between delirium and drug dependence/withdrawal reactions. (8) Sleep disruption can 
      induce delirium. (9) We should be vigilant against potential risk factors for 
      persistent or recurrent delirium. (10) Critically illness related delirium can 
      affect the diagnosis and treatment of primary diseases, and can also be alleviated 
      with the improvement of primary diseases. (11) Acute change of consciousness and 
      attention deficit are necessary for delirium diagnosis. (12) The combined assessment 
      of confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit and intensive care 
      delirium screening checklist can improve the sensitivity of delirium, especially 
      subclinical delirium. (13) Early identification and intervention of subclinical 
      delirium can reduce its risk of clinical delirium. (14) Daily assessment is helpful 
      for early detection of delirium. (15) Hopoactive delirium and mixed delirium are 
      common and should be emphasized. (16) Delirium may be accompanied by changes in 
      electroencephalogram. Bedside electroencephalogram monitoring should be used in the 
      ICU if conditions warrant. (17) Pay attention to differential diagnosis of delirium 
      and dementia/depression. (18) Pay attention to the role of rapid delirium screening 
      method in delirium management. (19) Assessment of the severity of delirium is an 
      essential part of the diagnosis of delirium. (20) The key to the management of 
      delirium is etiological treatment. (21) Improving environmental factors and making 
      patient comfort can help reduce delirium. (22) Early exercise can reduce the 
      incidence of delirium and shorten the duration of delirium. (23) Communication with 
      patients should be emphasized and strengthened. Family members participation can 
      help reduce the incidence of delirium and promote the recovery of delirium. (24) Pay 
      attention to the role of sleep management in the prevention and treatment of 
      delirium. (25) Dexmedetomidine can shorten the duration of hyperactive delirium or 
      prevent delirium. (26) When using antipsychotics to treat delirium, we should be 
      alert to its effect on the heart rhythm. (27) Delirium management should pay 
      attention to brain functional exercise. (28) Compared with non-critically illness 
      related delirium, the relief of critically illness related delirium will not 
      accomplished at one stroke. (29) Multiple management strategies such as ABCDEF, 
      eCASH and ESCAPE are helpful to prevent and treat delirium and improve the prognosis 
      of critically ill patients. (30) Shortening the duration of delirium can reduce the 
      occurrence of long-term cognitive impairment. (31) Multidisciplinary cooperation and 
      continuous quality improvement can improve delirium management. Consensus can 
      promote delirium management in critically ill patients, optimize analgesia and 
      sedation therapy, and even affect prognosis.

TI  - Sensorimotor function, balance abilities and pain influence Timed Up and Go 
      performance in older community-living people.
PG  - 196-201
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The Timed up and Go Test (TUG) is recommended as a screening 
      tool for fall risk in older people. It is assumed that this general mobility test is 
      underpinned by physiological factors such as strength, coordination and balance. 
      However, no studies have examined the range of physiological and psychological 
      factors which influence performance on this test. The aim of this study was to 
      examine the relative contributions of a range of sensorimotor, balance and 
      psychological factors to TUG performance in a large sample of older people. METHODS: 
      280 community-dwelling people aged 65 plus years (mean age 74.9, SD=6.4) underwent 
      the TUG test, as well as quantitative tests of vision, peripheral sensation, 
      strength, reaction time, balance, fear of falling, pain and vitality. RESULTS: The 
      time required to complete the TUG was significantly related to limitations in 
      instrumental activities of daily living and fear of falling. Many physiological and 
      psychological factors were significantly associated with TUG performance in 
      univariate analyses. Stepwise multiple regression analyses identified knee strength, 
      postural sway, reaction time, edge contrast sensitivity, MMSE score, SF12 body pain 
      and general health scores, number of medical conditions and age as significant and 
      independent predictors of TUG performance. Of these measures, the lower limb 
      strength measure explained most variance in TUG times. However, other sensorimotor, 
      balance, psychological and health measures provided important independent 
      information. The combined set of variables explained 43.5% of the variance in TUG 
      times (multiple r=0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that, in community-dwelling 
      older people, TUG performance is influenced by lower limb strength, balance, 
      reaction time, vision and pain, in addition to cognitive function and health status.

TI  - Reliability of Proxy-reported Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information 
      System Physical Function and Pain Interference Responses for Elderly Patients With 
      Musculoskeletal Injury.
PG  - e156-e165
LID - 10.5435/JAAOS-D-17-00644 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) 
      instruments are useful to evaluate health status, but its use can be challenging for 
      some vulnerable elderly patients, requiring aid from their proxies. Whether the 
      proxies could be accurate informants is unknown. The goal of this study was to 
      compare elderly patients' and their proxies' answers with PROMIS physical function 
      (PF) and pain interference (PI) computer adaptive test for the evaluation of 
      patients' outcomes after musculoskeletal injury. In addition, to correlate patients' 
      reported PF with the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test. METHODS: This prospective cohort 
      study, from February to September 2016, in the Orthopaedic trauma clinic of two 
      level I Trauma centers, included 273 patients aged 65 years or older, ambulatory, 
      cognitively intact, with a discernible proxy. PROMIS PF and PI, TUG, and the "FRAIL" 
      Questionnaire screening tool were performed. The correlation of PROMIS scores 
      between patients and proxies, and also with the TUG score, was assessed using 
      Spearman rank correlation. The Bland-Altman analysis served to check agreement and 
      bias. Subgroup comparison was tested using probit transformations. RESULTS: The mean 
      age of patients was 75.7 years, SD 7.5 (62.2 years; SD, 13.8 for proxies), 66.7% 
      women, 57.1% married, and 34% with femoral fractures. A significant correlation and 
      agreement of PROMIS PF and PI scores were found between patients and proxies 
      (Spearman rho for both, PF and PI = 0.73), although proxies tended to overestimate 
      the interference of pain on patient's performance (median difference, -1.7; P < 
      0.001). The correlation was markedly stronger in nonfrail patients and in those with 
      faster TUG scores. There was also a correlation between patients' PROMIS PF and TUG 
      test (Spearman rho = - 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: Proxies are good informants of the PF of 
      ambulatory, cognitively intact elderly patients, as evaluated by the PROMIS PF 
      instrument, after musculoskeletal injury, although they tend to slightly 
      overestimate PI. The use of proxy-reported PROs might better characterize functional 
      impairment and pain in a vulnerable patient population, and it could decrease 
      selection bias in outcomes research. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Diagnostic level II.

TI  - Impact of infant crying on mothers with a diagnosis of borderline personality 
      disorder: A qualitative study.
PG  - 405-421
LID - 10.1002/imhj.21776 [doi]
AB  - Mothers with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and their infants often have 
      compromised relationships. To further understand the complexities, this study 
      explored (a) the experiences of mothers with BPD in response to infant crying and 
      (b) how these parenting responses impact on mothers' interpersonal functioning with 
      significant others. Six mothers with clinical BPD were recruited from a mother-baby 
      psychiatric unit and interviewed using an interpretative phenomenological analysis 
      (IPA) approach. Transcripts of the semistructured interviews were coded for themes 
      and subthemes. Dominant themes revealed that mothers with BPD entered motherhood in 
      a psychologically fragile state, hypersensitive to experiencing intense 
      physiological-emotional pain and cognitive chaos in response to infant crying. 
      Automatic maladaptive flight-fright responses including suicide attempts were 
      common. A novel theme revealed some mothers' split identity, and only the "mother" 
      part could attend to infant crying. Finally, the data provided an understanding of 
      the detrimental domino effect on close family. Mothers also highlighted gaps in 
      accessibility of current mental health services and parenting programs, and their 
      desire to prevent the intergenerational transmission of attachment problems and BPD 
      symptoms to offspring. Clinical implications include antenatal BPD screening, 
      psychoeducation about infant crying, and greater access for programs supporting the 
      whole family to improve outcomes.

TI  - Cognitive Function During Opioid Tapering in Patients with Chronic Pain: A 
      Prospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 3385-3394
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S273025 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Evidence for efficacy and safety lacks for long-term opioid therapy in 
      patients with chronic non-cancer pain and adverse effects, including affection of 
      cognitive function and quality of life, is of concern. We aimed to investigate 
      cognitive function and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic 
      non-cancer pain during opioid reduction. PATIENTS AND METHODS: At two 
      multidisciplinary pain centers, all patients with planned opioid reduction were 
      screened for eligibility. Cognitive function was assessed using the Repeatable 
      Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) and Trail Making 
      Test A and B. Health-related quality of life was assessed using Short Form-36 (SF36) 
      and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: We included 51 
      participants and 40 participants attended follow-up of median 254 (IQR 106-357) 
      days. Baseline RBANS score was 82 (IQR 65-93) with reference population norm value 
      of 100 (SD±15). Daily opioid consumption was reduced from median 80 (IQR 45-161) 
      oral morphine milligram equivalents to 19 (IQR 0-60) mg. RBANS score estimate 
      increased by 6.2 (95% CI 3.1-9.3, p=0.0004) points after tapering. No differences 
      were observed for Trail Making Test times, HADS or SF36 scores. CONCLUSION: 
      Generally, cognitive function showed minor improvement after opioid tapering with 
      stationary health-related quality of life, depression and anxiety scores. The 
      clinical significance is unclear, as no minimal clinically important difference in 
      RBANS score is available.

AB  - AIM: To validate a visual acuity (VA) test application on touchpad in the screening 
      of pediatric population by comparing VA results obtained with conventional tests. 
      METHODS: A cohort of 101 patients, 44 girls and 57 boys with a median of 6.5 years 
      old (3-10 years of age), presenting for eye examinations in Ophthalmology Department 
      (Strasbourg, France) between November 1(st), 2018, and February 1(st), 2019 were 
      enrolled. Monocular and binocular VA testing was performed on the subject using both 
      a standard test and the touchpad application (Monoyer, "E" or, Pigassou depending of 
      children's capacities). Patients were excluded if they were physically or mentally 
      unable to use the touchpad. The duration of each tests, the painfulness, the 
      comprehension, the attention of children during the test and test's preferences were 
      also evaluated. RESULTS: There was a good linear correlation and intra-class 
      correlation coefficient [ICC=0.50 (0.34, 0.64) for binocular acuity, 0.74 (0.64, 
      0.82) for right eyes and 0.525 (0.37, 0.66) for left eye]. The standard errors of 
      measurement were very low (0.08, 0.05, 0.08 for binocular VA, right eyes VA and left 
      eyes VA, respectively). There was no difference between two tests for right eye 
      (P=0.126), left eye (P=0.098) and binocular acuity (P=0.085). Non inferiority was 
      proved for all binocular [-0.06 (-0.09, -0.03)], right eye [-0.04 (-0.07, -0.01)] 
      and left eye [-0.06 (-0.09, -0.02)] VA. The sensitivity and specificity, which 
      correspond to the ability for our app to detect amblyopia, were 92% and 80% 
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our touchpad application represents an efficient and valid

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review is to systematically review the 
      evidence relating to findings generated by multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) 
      following structural or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine if 
      this analysis is able to: a) Discriminate between individuals with musculoskeletal 
      pain and healthy controls, b) Predict pain perception in healthy individuals 
      stimulated with a noxious stimulus compared to those stimulated with a non-noxious 
      stimulus. METHODS: MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, PEDro, Google Scholar, Cochrane library 
      and Web of Science were systematically screened for relevant literature using 
      different combinations of keywords regarding structural and functional MRI analysed 
      with MVPA, both in individuals with musculoskeletal pain and healthy controls. 
      Reference lists of included articles were hand-searched for additional literature. 
      Eligible articles were assessed on risk of bias and reviewed by two independent 
      researchers. RESULTS: The search query returned 18 articles meeting the inclusion 
      criteria. Methodological quality varied from poor to good. Seven studies 
      investigated the ability of machine-learning algorithms to differentiate patient 
      groups from healthy control participants. Overall, the review demonstrated that MVPA 
      can discriminate between individuals with MSK pain and healthy controls with an 
      overall accuracy ranging from 53% to 94%. Twelve studies utilized healthy control 
      participants (using them as their own controls), during experimental pain paradigms 
      aimed to investigate the ability of machine-learning to differentiate individuals 
      stimulated with noxious stimuli from those stimulated with non-noxious stimuli, with 
      'pain' detection rates ranging from 60% to 94%. However, significant heterogeneity 
      in patient conditions, study methodology and brain imaging techniques resulted in 
      various findings that make study comparisons and formal conclusions challenging. 
      CONCLUSION: There is preliminary and emerging evidence that MVPA analyses of 
      structural or functional MRI are able to discriminate between patients and healthy 
      controls, and also discriminate between noxious and non-noxious stimulation. No 
      prospective studies were found in this review to allow determination of the 
      prognostic or diagnostic capabilities or treatment responsiveness of these analyses. 
      Future studies would also benefit from combining various behavioural, genotype and 
      phenotype data into analyses to assist with development of sensitive and specific 
      signatures that could guide future individualized patient treatment options and 
      evaluate how treatments exert their effects.

AB  - Many age-associated diseases are accompanied by pain. There is no doubt that pain is 
      underrecognized among elderly nursing home residents and the diagnosing of pain is a 
      real challenge in subjects with dementia. The aim of the study was to characterize 
      analgesic use among nursing home residents and to delineate the putative 
      associations between pain management and cognitive functions of elderly persons. The 
      study involved 392 subjects (males:females - 81:311) with a mean age of 83.6±5.9 
      years. The residents' medical files in relation to diagnoses and drug consumption 
      were analyzed, and the screening of cognitive functions was performed using the 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). One hundred and thirteen residents (28.8%) 
      received some analgesics. Among them 84 (21.4%) used them routinely, 25 (6.4%) - pro 
      re nata (PRN) and four (1.0%) - both routinely and PRN. Non-opioid analgesics were 
      taken routinely by 53 residents, weak opioids by nine subjects, and one person was 
      receiving strong opioids. Additionally, three individuals were taking a combination 
      preparation of tramadol and acetaminophen. The rate of subjects who were not 
      receiving any pain treatment was higher in residents with MMSE between 0 and 9 
      points than in those with MMSE between 24 and 30 points (P=0.0151). Furthermore, ten 
      residents (9.1%) with severe dementia were treated with analgesics PRN. The results 
      of our study point to a remarkably low use of analgesics in nursing home residents 
      in Poland and indicate a need to introduce pain evaluation and monitoring of drug 
      treatment appropriateness as a standard procedure in the geriatric assessment in 
      nursing homes.

LID - 10.1007/s10880-020-09749-x [doi]
AB  - Suicide rates are elevated in individuals with chronic illness, yet few studies have 
      examined risk factors for suicide in this population. Drawing from theoretical 
      models and risk factors identified in the suicide literature more broadly, this 
      article provides a conceptual overview of cognitive (e.g., pain catastrophizing, 
      self-criticism), affective (e.g., emotion dysregulation), interpersonal (e.g., 
      perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, critical expressed emotion), and 
      behavioral factors that may contribute, at least in part, to the link between 
      chronic illness, and illness-specific factors, and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. 
      We also outline several avenues for future research in this area and provide 
      specific considerations and recommendations for the screening, assessment, and 
      initial intervention of suicide risk within individuals with chronic health 
      conditions.

TI  - Spiritual Distress Within Inpatient Settings-A Scoping Review of Patients' and 
      Families' Experiences.

AB  - CONTEXT: Spiritual distress contributes to patients' and families' experiences of 
      care. OBJECTIVES: To map the literature on how seriously ill patients and their 
      family members experience spiritual distress within inpatient settings. METHODS: Our 
      scoping review included four databases using search terms "existential" or 
      "spiritual" combined with "angst," "anxiety," "distress," "stress," or "anguish." We 
      included original research describing experiences of spiritual distress among adult 
      patients or family members within inpatient settings and instrument validation 
      studies. Each study was screened in duplicate for inclusion, and the data from 
      included articles were extracted. Themes were identified, and data were synthesized. 
      RESULTS: Within the 37 articles meeting inclusion criteria, we identified six 
      themes: conceptualizing spiritual distress (n = 2), diagnosis and prevalence 
      (n = 7), assessment instrument development (n = 5), experiences (n = 12), associated 
      variables (n = 12), and barriers and facilitators to clinical support (n = 5). The 
      majority of studies focused on patients; two studies focused on family caregivers. 
      The most common clinical settings were oncology (n = 19) and advanced disease 
      (n = 19). Terminology to describe spiritual distress varied among studies. The 
      prevalence of at least moderate spiritual distress in patients was 10%-63%. 
      Spiritual distress was experienced in relation to self and others. Associated 
      variables included demographic, physical, cognitive, and psychological factors. 
      Barriers and facilitators were described. CONCLUSION: Patients' and families' 
      experiences of spiritual distress in the inpatient setting are multifaceted. 
      Important gaps in the literature include a narrow spectrum of populations, limited 
      consideration of family caregivers, and inconsistent terminology. Research 
      addressing these gaps may improve conceptual clarity and help clinicians better 
      identify spiritual distress.

AB  - Sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), excessive daytime 
      sleepiness (EDS) and fatigue, sleep deprivation and restless legs syndrome (RLS) are 
      increasingly seen in clinical practice. Sleep is considered vital for preserving 
      daytime cognitive function and physiological well-being. Sleep insufficiency may 
      have deleterious effects on work-life balance, overall health and safety. The 
      consequential economic burden at both the individual and societal levels is 
      significant. Moreover, sleep disorders are commonly associated with other major 
      medical problems such as chronic pain, cardiovascular disease, mental illness, 
      dementias, gastrointestinal disorders and diabetes mellitus. Thus, in order to 
      properly care for patients presenting with sleep-related morbidity, and to reduce 
      the consequential economic burden, accurate screening efforts and 
      efficacious/cost-effective treatments need to be developed and employed.

TI  - Cognitive impairment and postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing primary total 
      hip arthroplasty: A systematic review.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is a common surgical procedure in the 
      elderly. Varying degrees of cognitive impairment (CI) are frequently seen in this 
      patient population. To date, there has been no systematic review of the literature 
      specifically examining the impact of CI on outcomes after elective THA. The aim of 
      this systematic review was to identify studies that compare the postoperative 
      outcomes of patients with and without CI after undergoing elective primary THA. 
      DESIGN: We conducted a systematic review of prospective and retrospective studies. A 
      systematic literature review was conducted by searching MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase 
      from between January 1, 1997 and January 1, 2018. A total of 234 articles were 
      reviewed and 22 studies were selected. SETTING: Operating room and short-term and 
      long-term postoperative recovery up to 2 years. PATIENTS: Patients with CI who 
      underwent an elective primary THA that required general anesthesia with a comparator 
      group of patients who did not have dementia. INTERVENTIONS: Patients who underwent 
      elective primary total hip arthroplasty. MEASUREMENTS: Outcomes included 
      post-operative delirium (POD), mortality and other complications, discharge 
      disposition, length of stay (LOS), mortality, short-term (30 days) and long-term 
      (1 month-2 years) complications. MAIN RESULTS: 22 studies with 5,705,302 
      participants were included in the systematic review. Sample sizes varied greatly, 
      ranging from 14 to 2,924,995 participants. There was an association between patients 
      with CI and an increase in POD, in-hospital mortality, complications during 
      hospitalization, non-routine disposition, LOS, mortality between 1 month to 2 years, 
      and worse postoperative functional status. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that there 
      are strong associations between patients with pre-existing CI undergoing THA and 
      increased POD, hospital mortality, hospital complications, and hospital LOS. We 
      report good quality evidence linking complications after THA to preexisting CI. 
      Screening for CI can improve care and better predict the risk of developing 
      postoperative complications such as delirium. Further investigations can address 
      perioperative factors that can help reduce complications and show the utility of 
      more widespread assessment of preoperative cognitive impairment.

TI  - Clinical and Psychosocial Characteristics of Adolescent Pediatric Patients 
      Hospitalized after Different Types of Suicidal Behaviors-A Preliminary Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17155568 [doi]
LID - 5568
AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the clinical characteristics of 
      adolescents hospitalized after a suicide attempt or instrumental suicide-related 
      behavior. Participants included thirty-six adolescents from the pediatric unit of a 
      Polish hospital who made a nonfatal suicide attempt (SAA) or engaged in instrumental 
      suicide-related behavior (IBA), as well as a general population sample (GPS). 
      Psychosocial features were measured using the Kiddie Schedule for Affective 
      Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS), the Social and Occupational Functioning 
      Assessment Scale (SOFAS), the Suicide Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), the 
      Psychache Scale (TPS), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), the Center of 
      Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children (CES-DC), and the Prodromal 
      Questionnaire (PQ-16). The SAA group scored significantly higher than the IBA group 
      and the GPS in modules related to irritability and anhedonia, voice hallucinations 
      and delusions, suicidal acts, thoughts and ideation, and medical lethality. 
      Additionally, the SAA scored higher on the SBQ-R and PQ-16 compared to the IBA group 
      and the GPS. Although anxiety, mental pain, and depressive symptoms could not 
      independently distinguish between the SAA and IBA groups, psychotic symptoms were 
      more frequently present within the SAA group. The above symptoms may be important to 
      consider when screening for suicide risk in the general population.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infants can experience pain similar to adults, and improperly 
      controlled pain stimuli could have a long-term adverse impact on their cognitive and 
      neurological function development. The biggest challenge of achieving good infant 
      pain control is obtaining objective pain assessment when direct communication is 
      lacking. For years, computer scientists have developed many different facial 
      expression-centred machine learning (ML) methods for automatic infant pain 
      assessment. Many of these ML algorithms showed rather satisfactory performance and 
      have demonstrated good potential to be further enhanced for implementation in 
      real-world clinical settings. To date, there is no prior research that has 
      systematically summarised and compared the performance of these ML algorithms. Our 
      proposed meta-analysis will provide the first comprehensive evidence on this topic 
      to guide further ML algorithm development and clinical implementation. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: We will search four major public electronic medical and computer science 
      databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Embase and IEEE Xplore Digital Library 
      from January 2008 to present. All the articles will be imported into the Covidence 
      platform for study eligibility screening and inclusion. Study-level extracted data 
      will be stored in the Systematic Review Data Repository online platform. The primary 
      outcome will be the prediction accuracy of the ML model. The secondary outcomes will 
      be model utility measures including generalisability, interpretability and 
      computational efficiency. All extracted outcome data will be imported into RevMan 
      V.5.2.1 software and R V3.3.2 for analysis. Risk of bias will be summarised using 
      the latest Prediction Model Study Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. ETHICS AND 
      DISSEMINATION: This systematic review and meta-analysis will only use study-level 
      data from public databases, thus formal ethical approval is not required. The 
      results will be disseminated in the form of an official publication in a 
      peer-reviewed journal and/or presentation at relevant conferences. PROSPERO

PG  - 2135-43
LID - 10.3109/09638288.2015.1114154 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe what patients with chronic pain expect from a multimodal pain 
      rehabilitation programme. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Qualitative interviews were used to 
      uncover expectations about a multimodal rehabilitation programme offered at the Pain 
      and Rehabilitations Centre, The University Hospital; Linköping, Sweden. Sixteen 
      women and two men (mean age 37 years; standard deviation 10 years) with chronic 
      benign pain participated. The interviews were analysed using qualitative content 
      analyses. RESULTS: To participate actively in the multimodal pain rehabilitation 
      programme and to learn adequate coping strategies to improve daily life emerged as a 
      main category. It was based on the following four categories comprising expectations 
      about: participating actively in the programme, interacting with the professionals 
      and fellow patients, cognitive effects of the programme and tools for coping, and 
      explicit effects from the programme. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients expressed 
      expectations which may reflect that the information before the programme had started 
      rehabilitation process at the time point for this study. The results could be 
      applied in rehabilitation programmes by acknowledging expectations to interact with 
      professional team members and fellow patients, by early addressing of positive and 
      negative expectations about the future pain and by incorporating and strengthen 
      expectations of learning to cope with pain. Implications for Rehabilitation 
      Patients' expectations to interact with professional team members and fellow 
      patients by participating actively in the pain rehabilitation programme should be 
      acknowledged in each rehabilitation situation. Patients expressed both positive and 
      negative expectations about their future pain situation and these expectations 
      should be addressed as early as possible in the rehabilitation screening process. 
      Patients' expectations of learning to cope with pain should be incorporated and 
      strengthened in multimodal pain rehabilitation programmes.

PG  - 125-127
LID - 10.1213/XAA.0000000000000891 [doi]
AB  - Traditional systems of anesthesia evaluation do not routinely incorporate cognitive 
      screening into preoperative assessments of vital organ systems. Increasing 
      recognition of the importance of preoperative cognitive assessment of the elderly 
      surgical patient has resulted in a "call to action" from experts in this area. A 
      paradigm shift will be necessary to make this screening routine and not just a 
      research tool. We describe our preliminary experience with developing a training 
      program and implementing routine cognitive screening in a preoperative evaluation 
      clinic. We outline a process showing our successful clinical implementation of 
      sustainable cognitive stratification and documentation of routine cognitive 
      screening.

TI  - Psychometric evaluation of the Orofacial Pain Scale for Non-Verbal Individuals as a 
      screening tool for orofacial pain in people with dementia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the psychometric evaluation of the 
      Orofacial Pain Scale for Non-Verbal Individuals (OPS-NVI) as a screening tool for 
      orofacial pain in people with dementia. BACKGROUND: The OPS-NVI has recently been 
      developed and needs psychometric evaluation for clinical use in people with 
      dementia. The pain self-report is imperative as a reference standard and can be 
      provided by people with mild-to-moderate cognitive impairment. METHODS: The presence 
      of orofacial pain during rest, drinking, chewing and oral hygiene care was observed 
      in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia using the OPS-NVI. 
      Participants who were considered to present a reliable self-report were asked about 
      pain presence, and in all participants, the oral health was examined by a dentist 
      for the presence of potential painful conditions. After item-reduction, inter-rater 
      reliability and criterion validity were determined. RESULTS: The presence of 
      orofacial pain in this population was low (0%-10%), resulting in an average Positive 
      Agreement of 0%-100%, an average Negative Agreement of 77%-100%, a sensitivity of 
      0%-100% and a specificity of 66%-100% for the individual items of the OPS-NVI. At 
      the same time, the presence of oral problems, such as ulcers, tooth root remnants 
      and caries was high (64.5%). CONCLUSION: The orofacial pain presence in this MCI and 
      dementia population was low, resulting in low scores for average Positive Agreement 
      and sensitivity and high scores for average Negative Agreement and specificity. 
      Therefore, the OPS-NVI in its current form cannot be recommended as a screening tool 
      for orofacial pain in people with MCI and dementia. However, the inter-rater 
      reliability and criterion validity of the individual items in this study provide 
      more insight for the further adjustment of the OPS-NVI for diagnostic use. Notably, 
      oral health problems were frequently present, although no pain was reported or 
      observed, indicating that oral health problems cannot be used as a new reference 
      standard for orofacial pain, and a regular oral examination by care providers and 
      oral hygiene care professionals remains indispensable.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years there has been an increasing number of elderly people 
      who care for another elderly person in the same household. These elderly people are 
      more susceptible to overload and the presence of chronic pain, while pain can 
      negatively influence cognitive variables. OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance and 
      cognitive processing of elderly caregivers and non-caregivers with and without 
      chronic pain. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study carried out among 149 
      elderly people divided into four groups that were matched according to sex, age and 
      schooling. The tests used were a numerical pain assessment scale, the Brief 
      Cognitive Screening Battery (BCSB), Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACER-R) and 
      cognitive processing through event-related potentials (P300). RESULTS: Statistically 
      significant differences between participants with and without chronic pain were 
      found with regard to attention/orientation (p=0.045) and visual-spatial skills 
      (p=0.017), and in the total score (p=0.033). In the pain-free group, the caregivers 
      showed better results than the non-caregivers. There were no effects between 
      subjects or interactions (caregiving and pain factors) either on P300 amplitude or 
      on P300 latency. CONCLUSION: In general, it was observed that pain-free individuals 
      presented better performance. No relationship was observed between the factors care 
      and pain regarding cognitive performance.

AB  - Numerous studies on the high prevalence of sleep disorders in individuals with 
      traumatic brain injury (TBI) have been conducted in the past few decades. These 
      disorders can accentuate other consequences of TBI, negatively impacting mood, 
      exacerbating pain, heightening irritability, and diminishing cognitive abilities and 
      the potential for recovery. Nevertheless, sleep is not routinely assessed in this 
      population. In our review, we examined the selective screening criteria and the 
      scientific evidence regarding screening for post-TBI sleep disorders to identify 
      gaps in our knowledge that are in need of resolution. We retrieved papers written in 
      the English-language literature before June 2012 pertinent to the discussion on 
      sleep after TBI found through a PubMed search. Within our research, we found that 
      sleep dysfunction is highly burdensome after TBI, treatment interventions for some 
      sleep disorders result in favorable outcomes, sensitive and specific tests to detect 
      sleep disorders are available, and the cost-effectiveness and sustainability of 
      screening have been determined from other populations. The evidence we reviewed 
      supports screening for post-TBI sleep dysfunction. This approach could improve the 
      outcomes and reduce the risks for post-TBI adverse health and nonhealth effects 
      (e.g., secondary injuries). A joint sleep and brain injury collaboration focusing on 
      outcomes is needed to improve our knowledge.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The assessment of pain intensity is mandatory in many medical 
      disciplines. However, several pitfalls are associated with this task, as, for 
      example, the selection of an instrument which is suitable for different groups of 
      patients; the reliable and valid interpretation of the results, etc. Thus, the aim 
      of the present review is to summarise the recent literature on this topic and to 
      provide a selection of suitable instruments to assess pain intensity in different 
      groups of patients. METHODS: The recent literature was screened and summarised. 
      RESULTS: Assessment of pain has to be performed in consideration of the target 
      population (e. g., age, health condition, cognitive function). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      selection of appropriate pain measurement scales is mandatory for achieving valid 
      results.

AB  - Inflammatory rheumatic diseases have a long-lasting effect on patients' physical and 
      psychological functioning, for instance, due to disabling symptoms and unpredictable 
      disease course. Consequently, many patients show adjustment problems such as 
      depressed mood, which in turn can negatively influence their disease outcome. 
      Specific biopsychosocial factors have shown to affect this outcome. For example, 
      daily stress, cognitive-behavioral risk factors such as pain catastrophizing and 
      avoidance, and resilience factors such as optimism and social support influence the 
      quality of life, physical symptoms of pain and fatigue, and inflammatory markers. 
      Psychological interventions tackling these factors can have beneficial effects on 
      physical and psychological functioning. Recent advances in screening for patients at 
      risk, tailored treatment, and eHealth further broaden the efficiency and scope of 
      these interventions while simultaneously optimizing patient empowerment. This 
      chapter describes the biopsychosocial risk and resilience factors related to disease 
      outcome and the possible benefits of psychological treatment strategies in 
      inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

      Review.

LID - 10.2147/AMEP.S266469 [doi]
AB  - Screen-based simulation (SBS) using digital technology has been demonstrated to 
      improve the cognitive and psychomotor skills of anesthesia trainees. As a method of 
      education and evaluation, this form of simulation offers multiple advantages related 
      to cost, availability, simplicity, repeatability, and scorability. Online use of SBS 
      with software employing standard cloud-based peer-to-peer platforms allows for 
      instruction at a distance of important anesthesia-related critical thinking skills 
      including crisis management. Despite the fact that there are no studies concerning 
      the application of SBS in anesthesia distance education, this form of instruction 
      has increased as a result of quarantine measures associated with the coronavirus-2 
      pandemic that have disrupted traditional in-person mannequin-based simulation, and 
      its usage likely will continue through the post-pandemic era for multiple reasons. 
      Several options exist for asynchronous and synchronous teaching of anesthesia skills 
      at a distance with SBS, and there are useful techniques that can assist in achieving 
      these educational goals with this process.

TI  - Effects of pain intensity on goal schemas and goal pursuit: a daily diary study.
PG  - 968-76
LID - 10.1037/hea0000093 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Although the adverse effects of chronic pain on work productivity and 
      daily life pursuits are clear, the within-person dynamics of pain, goal cognition, 
      and engagement in work-related and lifestyle goals remain uncharted. This study 
      investigated the impact of pain intensity (assessed on 3 occasions each day) and 
      goal-related schematic thinking (ratings of importance, planning, and goal pursuit 
      opportunities, assessed only in the morning) on afternoon and evening work and 
      lifestyle goal pursuit. METHODS: A community sample of working adults with chronic 
      pain (N = 131) were screened and interviewed about their work and lifestyle goals 
      and completed a 21-day telephonic diary. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to 
      estimate within-person and between-person effects. RESULTS: At the within-person 
      level, morning pain intensity was inversely related to schematic cognition 
      concerning work and lifestyle goals, whereas, at the between-person level, morning 
      pain intensity varied positively with schematic thinking about work goals as well 
      with afternoon lifestyle goal pursuit. At both the between- and within- analytic 
      levels, morning goal schemas were positively associated with the pursuit of each 
      type of goal in the afternoon and again in the evening. Moreover, positive 
      carry-over effects of morning goal schemas on next day afternoon goal pursuit were 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas morning pain intensity exhibited inconsistent effects 
      across analytic levels, morning goal-related schematic thinking consistently 
      predicted goal pursuit across analytic levels, type of goal, and time of day. These 
      findings have implications for treatment and prevention of pain's potentially 
      deleterious effects on workplace and lifestyle goals.

TI  - Disability and Contextual Factors in Patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis - A 
      Three-Year Observational Study.
PG  - 439-449
LID - 10.3233/JND-180322 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease 
      characterized by muscle weakness and wasting. Observational natural history studies 
      can give information on body function/structure impairments, activity limitations 
      and participation restrictions, i.e. disability. Information needed to plan and 
      develop care and support. OBJECTIVE: To describe and explore disease severity and 
      impairments, activity limitations, participation restrictions and contextual factors 
      over time. In specific, to explore concurrent presence of cognitive impairment, 
      fatigue, anxiety, depression and pain, and whether these impairments were related to 
      disease severity. METHODS: In this three-year observational study, 60 patients with 
      ALS were included at baseline. Follow-ups were performed every 6 months unless 
      participants had deceased or declined participation. Data was collected from medical 
      records, and by study-specific and standardized questionnaires administrated during 
      home visits. RESULTS: Regardless of disease severity; fatigue, anxiety, depression 
      and pain were present in patients with ALS at each data collection. Approximately 
      one-third experienced two or more of these impairments concurrently, i.e. at the 
      same time point. Cognitive impairment could not be assessed in many patients due to 
      their physical impairments. Disease severity was not associated with fatigue, 
      anxiety, depression or pain. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with ALS need, throughout the 
      course of the disease, to be regularly screened for commonly present impairments, 
      activity limitations and participation restrictions so that person-centered 
      interventions can be applied at the right time.

AB  - Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is commonly comorbid with a range of physical 
      health conditions. The aim of this study was to examine the association between 
      index trauma and PTSD symptom clusters with physical health conditions, among 
      individuals with PTSD in a population-based sample. Data were analyzed from the 
      2012-2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions 
      (NESARC-III; N = 36,309). Past-year PTSD (n = 1779) was assessed using a clinical 
      interview in accordance with DSM-5 criteria. Multiple logistic regression models 
      examined the associations between PTSD symptom clusters and index trauma with 
      physical health conditions. Results of the most stringent model, adjusting for 
      sociodemographics, other psychiatric conditions, and other PTSD symptom clusters, 
      indicated re-experiencing symptoms were associated with cardiovascular and 
      endocrine/metabolic conditions (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) range: 1.18-1.33) and 
      negative alterations in mood and cognition symptoms were associated with sleep 
      disorder (AOR = 1.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) [1.04-1.30], p = .009). Results 
      also demonstrated significant associations between life-threatening illness with 
      cancer, digestive, and neurologic conditions (AOR range: 2.10-3.42) and 
      life-threatening injury with musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions (AOR range: 
      1.76-2.04). Finally, significant associations emerged between psychological trauma 
      with musculoskeletal and neurologic conditions (AOR range: 0.48-0.66), and other 
      trauma with digestive conditions and anemia (AOR range: 0.38-0.47). Results suggest 
      PTSD symptomatology and index trauma play a differential role in their association 
      with variable physical health conditions. Results may inform screening practices and 
      targeted interventions to mitigate risk of PTSD and physical health conditions.

TI  - Executive Functioning in Youth With and Without Chronic Pain: A Comparative 
      Analysis.
PG  - 102-117
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000895 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Preliminary research in youth with chronic pain suggests differences in 
      attention and working memory, which has been similarly demonstrated in adults with 
      chronic pain. There has been little research on other aspects of executive 
      functioning (EF) in this population despite its critical role in problem solving, 
      school functioning, and coping. This study aimed to examine differences in several 
      aspects of EF between youth with chronic pain and a nonchronic pain comparison group 
      using performance-based neuropsychological tests and a behavior rating scale. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants completed ratings of pain; physical, emotional, 
      social, and school functioning; sleep quality; medication; and a general 
      intelligence screener. Standardized neuropsychological tests were used to examine EF 
      with a focus on working memory, divided and alternating attention, inhibition, 
      flexibility, incidental memory, and planning. A parent-report and self-report 
      behavior rating of EF was also administered. RESULTS: Recruitment from 2 
      tertiary-care pain clinics resulted in a sample of 26 youth with chronic pain (80.8% 
      girls) and their parents. A comparison group of 30 youth without chronic pain and 
      their parents were recruited from the community. Participants with chronic pain had 
      significantly lower scores on several performance-based tests of working 
      memory/divided attention, inhibition, and flexibility/alternating attention than the 
      comparison group. Statistically significant group differences were also found on 
      behavior ratings of emotion control, shifting, task initiation and completion, 
      working memory, planning and organization, overall emotion and cognitive regulation 
      as well as global EF. Covariate analysis was conducted in all analyses where there 
      were significant group differences and several observed group differences remained. 
      DISCUSSION: This study is one of few multidimensional examinations of EF in youth 
      with chronic pain, using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery combined 
      with behavior ratings. Our findings suggest EF differences in youth with chronic 
      pain, across a variety of domains and may suggest risk for specific cognitive 
      processing weaknesses in this population. Medical and educational teams should work 
      toward identification, treatment, and compensatory support for EF within 
      individualized pain management for youth.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Emotional and cognitive impairments are common 
      comorbidities of chronic neuropathic pain that significantly impact the quality of 
      life of patients. While the nociceptive components of the peripheral nerve chronic 
      constriction injury (CCI) animal model have been extensively analyzed, data related 
      to the development of mood and cognitive disorders, and especially its impact on 
      female rats remains fragmented. We systematically reviewed the literature analyzing 
      the methods used to induce and evaluate the development of emotional- and 
      cognitive-like impairments and sex-specific differences in the CCI model. DATABASES 
      AND DATA TREATMENT: We searched PubMed, Google Scholar and Web of Science from 
      inception to September 30th, 2019, and a total of 44 papers were considered eligible 
      for inclusion. We included animal studies assessing nociception, locomotion, 
      anxious-like, depressive-like and cognitive behaviours after the CCI induction. 
      RESULTS: The overall quality of the studies was considered moderate to high. 
      Overall, the induction of CCI leads to the development of emotional impairments, 
      namely anxiety- and depressive-like behaviours, as well as cognitive impairments. 
      With the majority of the studies using male subjects, the lack of evidence on female 
      animals prevents the evaluation of sex-specific differences. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review supports the development of an anxiodepressive-like phenotype, associated 
      with cognitive impairments, in CCI-induced animals. These results support the use of 
      this animal model for the study of the mechanisms underlying these comorbidities, as 
      well as a screening tool for the development/repurposing of drugs that tackle both 
      the neuropathy-induced nociceptive and emotional impairments, such as tricyclic 
      antidepressants. Importantly, our review also highlights the need for studies 
      performed in female rodents as these are almost non-existent.

      widespread pain, sleep disturbance, and cognitive dysfunction. Sleep disorders are 
      thought to play a prominent role in the etiology and symptomatic management of FM, 
      specifically obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). In order to provide collaborative care, 
      we need a better understanding of any overlapping presentation of FM and OSA. We 
      conducted a site-wide review of patients from 2012-2016 to identify FM patients 
      diagnosed with OSA. Methods: Charts were reviewed in patients aged 18 and above from 
      2012-2016 using ICD codes from a clinical data repository. Intersection of patients 
      with a diagnosis of FM and OSA in clinics of psychiatry, sleep, rheumatology, and 
      other outpatient clinics was compared. Polysomnography order patterns for FM 
      patients were investigated. Results: Co-morbidity was highest in the sleep clinic 
      (85.8%) compared to psychiatry (42.0%), rheumatology (18.7%), and other outpatient 
      clinics (3.6%) (p<0.001). In the rheumatology and other outpatient clinics, 93.5% 
      and 96% of patients respectively, had no polysomnography ordered. Pairwise 
      comparison of co-morbidity in clinics: sleep vs psychiatry, sleep vs rheumatology, 
      sleep vs other clinics, psychiatry vs rheumatology, psychiatry vs other clinics, and 
      rheumatology vs other clinics were statistically significant after applying a Sidak 
      adjustment to the p-values (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Our analysis suggests that 
      there could be a correlation between FM and OSA, and referral to sleep studies is 
      recommended in the management of patients with FM. The varying prevalence of FM 
      patients with co-morbid OSA in sleep clinics when compared to other outpatient 
      clinics suggests a discrepancy in the identification of FM patients with OSA. When 
      properly screened, OSA co-morbidity has the potential to be higher in other 
      outpatient clinics.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Preliminary evidence suggest a possible relationship between 
      perioperative hyperglycemia, postoperative delirium (POD) or cognitive dysfunction 
      (POCD). We aim to present the available clinical evidence related to chronic (i.e. 
      diabetes mellitus) or acute perioperative hyperglycemia as risk factors for 
      POD/POCD. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A literature search of EMBASE (via Ovid, 
      1974-present) online medical database and MEDLINE (via PubMed or Ovid, 1946-present) 
      was performed. All types of clinical studies including randomized controlled trials, 
      prospective, as well as retrospective cohort studies were screened. Clinical studies 
      that reported original information on the relationship between diabetes mellitus 
      (DM) and/or acute perioperative abnormal glucose levels and POD or POCD were 
      selected. Reviews and editorials (i.e. articles not presenting original preclinical 
      or clinical research) were excluded and case-reports were not considered for 
      analysis. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Our search resulted in 2356 papers for screening, from 
      which we selected 29 studies that met our inclusion criteria. DM was investigated in 
      24 observational papers, acute perioperative hyperglycemia in six observational 
      studies and two randomized controlled trials examined the effect of perioperative 
      glucose lowering on POD/POCD. Diabetes was associated with POD or POCD in 18/24 
      observational studies and 6/6 of the included observational studies found that 
      perioperative hyperglycemia was associated with POD/POCD, independent of diabetes. 
      The two randomized controlled trials had a different trial design and reported 
      conflicting results. CONCLUSIONS: According to the available evidence, DM and acute 
      perioperative hyperglycemia may be associated with an increased risk for POD/POCD. 
      These conclusions are based mostly on observational studies and deserve more and 
      dedicated research. This systematic review may direct the design of future studies.

AB  - Age increases vulnerability, commonly accompanied by greater reliance on others and 
      susceptibility to maltreatment. Physiologic processes become less resilient; the 
      potential for harm from medical care increases. Awareness of frailty, functional, 
      social, and potential maltreatment issues enables early referrals to help the 
      patient maintain her independence. Health issues that may impede both gynecologic 
      care and self-sufficiency include sensory deficits, physical disability, and 
      cognitive impairment. Speaking slowly and providing contextual information enhance 
      patient comprehension. Cancer screening depends on life expectancy. Osteoporosis 
      treatment requires managing fall risk. Gynecologic symptoms more likely have 
      multiple contributing factors than one etiology. Incontinence is a particularly 
      complex issue, but invariably includes bladder diary assessment and pelvic floor 
      muscle training. Function and frailty measures best predict perioperative morbidity. 
      Communication with the patient, her family, other providers, and health care 
      organizations is an important frontier in avoiding errors and adverse outcomes.

AB  - There are few cognitive screening tools appropriate for fast-paced settings with 
      limited staffing, and particularly in preoperative evaluation clinics. The Society 
      for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) convened experts in 
      neuropsychology, geriatric medicine, and anesthesiology to conduct a review of the 
      literature and compile a comprehensive list of cognitive screening tools used within 
      primary care and preoperative settings. This Recommendations Statement: 1. 
      summarizes a review of the literature on existing cognitive screening tools used 
      within preoperative settings; 2. discusses factors to consider when selecting 
      cognitive screening tools in a preoperative environment; and 3. includes a work flow 
      diagram to guide use of these screening measures. Methodology involved searching 
      peer-reviewed literature for 29 cognitive screening tools which were identified from 
      the literature that fit inclusion criteria. Of these 29, seven tests have been used 
      in preoperative settings and are discussed. These seven had an average 
      administration time ranging from one to ten minutes. Memory, language, and attention 
      were the most commonly evaluated cognitive domains. Most had adequate sensitivity 
      and specificity to detect cognitive impairment/dementia. While information on the 
      psychometric properties of these tools is limited, the tools discussed are 
      appropriate for lay examiners, are short in duration, and accessible for free or at 
      a low cost. We describe factors that must be considered prior to instrument 
      selection.

AB  - AIM: This study reviewed the perceptions and strategies of drug users and nurses 
      with regard to pain management in acute care settings. BACKGROUND: Drug users 
      present unique challenges in acute care settings with pain management noted to be at 
      best suboptimal, at worst non-existent. Little is known about why and specifically 
      how therapeutic effectiveness is compromised. DESIGN: Qualitative: constructivist 
      grounded theory. METHOD: A constructivist grounded theory approach incorporating a 
      constant comparative method of data collection and analysis was applied. The data 
      corpus comprised interviews with drug users (n = 11) and five focus groups (n = 22) 
      of nurses and recovering drug users. RESULTS: Moral relativism as the core category 
      both represents the phenomenon and explains the basic social process. Nurses and 
      drug users struggle with moral relativism when addressing the issue of pain 
      management in the acute care setting. Drug users lay claim to expectations of 
      compassionate care and moralise via narration. Paradoxically, nurses report that the 
      caring ideal and mutuality of caring are diminished. Drug users' individual 
      sensitivities, anxieties and felt stigma in conjunction with opioid-induced 
      hyperalgesia complicate the processes. Nurses' and hospitals' organisational 
      routines challenge drug user rituals and vice versa leading both protagonists to 
      become disaffected. Consequently, key clinical issues such as preventing withdrawal 
      and managing pain are left unaddressed and therapeutic effectiveness is compromised. 
      CONCLUSION: This study provides a robust account of nurses' and drug users' struggle 
      with pain management in the acute care setting. Quick technological fixes such as 
      urine screens, checklists or the transient effects of (cognitive-based) education 
      (or training) are not the answer. This study highlights the need for nurses to 
      engage meaningfully with this perceptibly 'difficult' group of patients. RELEVANCE 
      TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The key aspects likely to contribute to problematic 
      interactions with this patient cohort are outlined so that they can be prevented 
      and, or addressed.

      accurately assess delirium is hugely challenging. OBJECTIVES: This review focused on 
      the optimal clinical and research application of delirium assessment tools and 
      methods in palliative care settings. METHODS: In addition to multidisciplinary input 
      from delirium researchers and other relevant stakeholders at an international 
      meeting, we searched PubMed (1990-2012) and relevant reference lists to identify 
      delirium assessment tools used either exclusively or partly in the context of 
      palliative care. RESULTS: Of the 26 delirium scales identified, we selected six for 
      in-depth review: three screening tools, two severity measures, and one research tool 
      for neuropsychological assessment of delirium. These tools differed regarding 
      intended use, ease of use, training requirements, psychometric properties, and 
      validation in or suitability for palliative care populations. The Nursing Delirium 
      Screening Scale, Single Question in Delirium, or Confusion Assessment Method, 
      ideally with a brief attention test, can effectively screen for delirium. Favoring 
      inclusivity, use of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-IV 
      criteria gives the best results for delirium diagnosis. The Revised Delirium Rating 
      Scale and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale are the best available options for 
      monitoring severity, and the Cognitive Test for Delirium provides detailed 
      neuropsychological assessment for research purposes. CONCLUSION: Given the unique 
      characteristics of patients in palliative care settings, further contextually 
      sensitive studies of delirium assessment are required in this population.

TI  - What are the predictors, barriers and facilitators to effective management of acute 
      pain in children by ambulance services? A mixed-methods systematic review protocol.
PG  - 22-28

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The management of pain is complex, especially in children, as age, 
      developmental level, cognitive and communication skills and associated beliefs must 
      be considered. Without effective pain treatment, children may suffer long-term 
      changes in stress hormone responses and pain perception and are at risk of 
      developing posttraumatic stress disorder. Pre-hospital analgesic treatment of 
      injured children is suboptimal, with very few children in pain receiving analgesia. 
      The aim of this review is to identify predictors, barriers and facilitators to 
      effective management of acute pain in children by ambulance services. METHODS: A 
      mixed-methods approach has been adopted due to the research question lending itself 
      to qualitative and quantitative inquiry. The segregated methodology will be used 
      where quantitative and qualitative papers are synthesised separately, followed by 
      mixed-methods synthesis (meta-integration). We will search from inception: MEDLINE, 
      CINAHL and PsycINFO via EBSCOHost, EMBASE via Ovid SP, Web of Science and Scopus. 
      The Cochrane Library, the Joanna Briggs Institute, PROSPERO, ISRCTN and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov will be searched. We will include empirical qualitative and 
      quantitative studies. We will exclude animal studies, reviews, audits, service 
      evaluations, simulated studies, letters, Best Evidence Topics, case studies, 
      self-efficacy studies, comments and abstracts. Two authors will perform full 
      screening and selection, data extraction and quality assessment. GRADE and CERQual 
      will determine the confidence in cumulative evidence. DISCUSSION: If confidence in 
      the cumulative evidence is deemed Moderate, Low or Very Low, then this review will 
      inform the development of a novel mixed-methods sequential explanatory study which 
      aims to comprehensively identify predictors, barriers and facilitators to effective 
      pain management of acute pain in children within ambulance services. Future research 
      will be discussed among authors if confidence is deemed High.Systematic Review

AB  - GOAL: Depression and anxiety are important complications of stroke but are 
      underdiagnosed in community settings. The current study identified which patients 
      were at increased risk of developing either disorder more than1 year poststroke to 
      assist in targeted screening. METHODS: Crosssectional survey of 147 adults who had a 
      stroke more than 1 year ago were recruited from stroke advocacy/support groups and 
      an outpatient register. Participants completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression 
      Scale (HADS) and reported whether they had emotional problems as a stroke inpatient 
      (single item: yes/no). Standardized self-report measures evaluated medical (physical 
      independence, health-related quality of life), cognitive (memory, executive 
      functioning), and psychological (social support) variables. Demographic and 
      stroke-related (stroke type, year) information were also recorded. FINDINGS: Between 
      53% and 80% of respondents (n = 117) screened positive for depressed mood and/or 
      anxiety (HADS subscale cut-offs: ≥8 or ≥4). Logistic regression analyses indicated 
      that stroke survivors who reported having emotional problems as inpatients (odds 
      ratio [OR]: 0.23), were female (OR: 3.42), and had poor health-related quality of 
      life (OR: 0.45-0.53) and cognitive problems (OR: 0.68-0.74), were more likely to 
      screen positive for either disorder. Models based on these variables predicted 
      screening outcomes with 91% accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: Community-based stroke survivors 
      who reported experiencing emotional problems as inpatients, were female, or had poor 
      health-related quality of life (chronic pain, disturbed sleep, communication 
      difficulties) and/or cognitive issues were at greater risk of being 
      depressed/anxious. Targeted screening of these patients may help to identify those 
      who are most in need of more comprehensive clinical assessments and evidence-based 
      interventions.

TI  - Value of quantitative sensory testing in neurological and pain disorders: NeuPSIG 
      consensus.
PG  - 1807-1819
LID - 10.1016/j.pain.2013.05.047 [doi]
AB  - Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a psychophysical method used to quantify 
      somatosensory function in response to controlled stimuli in healthy subjects and 
      patients. Although QST shares similarities with the quantitative assessment of 
      hearing or vision, which is extensively used in clinical practice and research, it 
      has not gained a large acceptance among clinicians for many reasons, and in 
      significant part because of the lack of information about standards for performing 
      QST, its potential utility, and interpretation of results. A consensus meeting was 
      convened by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International 
      Association for the Study of Pain (NeuPSIG) to formulate recommendations for 
      conducting QST in clinical practice and research. Research studies have confirmed 
      the utility of QST for the assessment and monitoring of somatosensory deficits, 
      particularly in diabetic and small fiber neuropathies; the assessment of evoked 
      pains (mechanical and thermal allodynia or hyperalgesia); and the diagnosis of 
      sensory neuropathies. Promising applications include the assessment of evoked pains 
      in large-scale clinical trials and the study of conditioned pain modulation. In 
      clinical practice, we recommend the use QST for screening for small and large fiber 
      neuropathies; monitoring of somatosensory deficits; and monitoring of evoked pains, 
      allodynia, and hyperalgesia. QST is not recommended as a stand-alone test for the 
      diagnosis of neuropathic pain. For the conduct of QST in healthy subjects and in 
      patients, we recommend use of predefined standardized stimuli and instructions, 
      validated algorithms of testing, and reference values corrected for anatomical site, 
      age, and gender. Interpretation of results should always take into account the 
      clinical context, and patients with language and cognitive difficulties, anxiety, or 
      litigation should not be considered eligible for QST. When appropriate standards, as 
      discussed here, are applied, QST can provide important and unique information about 
      the functional status of somatosensory system, which would be complementary to 
      already existing clinical methods.

AB  - Insomnia can be lethal, increasing the risk of suicide and accidental death by 
      overdose. In this review we present a synthesis of the literature investigating the 
      insomnia-suicide link and the psychological mechanisms underpinning the association. 
      Specifically, we review the findings of prospective epidemiological studies 
      demonstrating the insomnia-suicide link in adult and adolescent community 
      populations. Robust associations between insomnia and suicide are observed in 
      clinically depressed and anxious populations, and there are indications across a 
      number of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that these linkages are 
      attributable to a disrupted sleep pattern, dysfunctional beliefs about sleep and 
      nightmares, independent of depression and anxiety symptoms. Borderline personality 
      disorder (BPD) and chronic pain (CP) are highlighted as high-risk subgroups given 
      the elevated rates of insomnia and suicidality in both conditions. Aside from the 
      influence of comorbid depression and anxiety symptoms, emerging evidence has 
      identified impulsivity and emotional dysregulation as possible mechanisms driving 
      the insomnia-suicide link in BPD, and catastrophizing and the sense of 
      defeat/entrapment as potential cognitive pathways through which insomnia aggravates 
      suicidality in CP. Screening for, and interventions that tackle, insomnia and these 
      associated psychological mechanisms, offer a novel avenue for reducing suicidality 
      across a range of clinical and non-clinical populations.

TI  - Routine alcohol screening in the ED: unscreened patients have an increased risk for 
      hazardous alcohol use.
PG  - 206-211

AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine screening programmes for hazardous alcohol use in the ED miss 
      large numbers of patients. We investigated whether patient-related or staff-related 
      factors cause screening failures and whether unscreened patients are at increased 
      risk of hazardous alcohol use. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis of a 
      prospective study. From November 2012 to November 2013, all adult patients visiting 
      a Dutch inner city ED were screened for hazardous alcohol consumption using the 
      Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption. Reasons for failure of 
      screening were categorised as: (A) patient is unable to cooperate (due to illness or 
      pain, decreased consciousness or incomprehension due to intoxication, psychiatric, 
      cognitive or neurological disorder or language barrier), (B) healthcare professional 
      forgot to ask, (C) patient refuses cooperation and (D) screening was recently 
      performed (<6 months ago). Presence of risk factors for hazardous alcohol use was 
      compared between screened and unscreened patients. RESULTS: Of the 28 019 ED 
      patients, 18 310 (65%) were screened and 9709 (35%) were not. In 7150 patients staff 
      forgot to screen, whereas 2559 patients were not screened due to patient factors 
      (2340 being unable and 219 unwilling). Patients with any of these risk factors were 
      less likely to be screened: male sex, alcohol-related visit, any intoxication, head 
      injury, any kind of wound and major trauma. In multivariate analysis, all these risk 
      factors were independently associated with not being screened. Patients with at 
      least one risk factor for hazardous alcohol use were less likely to be screened. 
      Highest prevalence of risk factors was found in patients unable or unwilling to 
      cooperate. CONCLUSION: Patients who do not undergo routine screening for alcohol use 
      at triage in the ED have an increased risk for hazardous alcohol use. These data 
      highlight the importance of screening patients, especially those initially unwilling 
      or unable to cooperate, at a later stage.

TI  - The Association of a Frailty Index and Incident Delirium in Older Hospitalized 
      Patients: An Observational Cohort Study.
PG  - 2053-2061
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S249284 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: Frailty identifies patients that have vulnerability to 
      stress. Acute illness and hospitalization are stressors that may result in delirium 
      and further accelerate the negative consequences of frailty. PURPOSE: The purpose of 
      this study was to determine whether frailty, identified at hospital admission and as 
      measured by a frailty index, is associated with incident delirium. METHODS: A 
      retrospective, observational, cohort study was done at a Veterans hospital between 
      January 2013 and March 2014. English-speaking patients over 55 years were eligible. 
      Exclusion criteria included inability to complete baseline assessments due to 
      pre-existing cognitive impairment, emergent surgery; and/or admission from a nursing 
      home, pre-existing delirium, and those with psychiatric disease or substance use 
      disorder. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Frailty index (FI) variables included 
      cognitive screening, physical function and comorbidities. The FI was calculated as a 
      proportion of possible deficits (range 0 to 1; higher scores indicate increased 
      frailty). Incident delirium was measured daily by an expert clinician interview. 
      RESULTS: A total of 247 patients were admitted and 218 met inclusion/exclusion 
      criteria, with a mean age of 71.54 years (SD = 9.53 years) and were predominantly 
      white (92.7%) and male (91.7%). Participants were grouped using FI ranges as 
      non-frail (FI <0.25, n=56 (26%)), pre-frail (FI =0.25-0.35, n=86 (39%)), and frail 
      (FI >0.35, n=76 (35%)). Pre-frailty and frailty were associated with incident 
      delirium (non-frail: 3.6% vs pre-frail: 20.9% vs frail: 29.3%, p=0.001) and total 
      delirium days (mean day =non-frail 0.04 vs pre-frail 0.35 vs frail 0.57, p=0.003). 
      After adjustment for sociodemographic factors, pre-frail (adjusted OR=5.64, 95% CI: 
      1.23, 25.99) and frail status (adjusted OR=6.80, 95% CI: 1.38, 33.45) were 
      independently associated with delirium. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a 
      frailty index is independently associated with incident delirium and suggests that 
      admission assessments for frailty may identify patients at high risk of developing 
      delirium.

TI  - Careless responding in internet-based quality of life assessments.
PG  - 1077-1088
LID - 10.1007/s11136-017-1767-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Quality of life (QoL) measurement relies upon participants providing 
      meaningful responses, but not all respondents may pay sufficient attention when 
      completing self-reported QoL measures. This study examined the impact of careless 
      responding on the reliability and validity of Internet-based QoL assessments. 
      METHODS: Internet panelists (n = 2000) completed Patient-Reported Outcomes 
      Measurement Information System (PROMIS®) short-forms (depression, fatigue, pain 
      impact, applied cognitive abilities) and single-item QoL measures (global health, 
      pain intensity) as part of a larger survey that included multiple checks of whether 
      participants paid attention to the items. Latent class analysis was used to identify 
      groups of non-careless and careless responders from the attentiveness checks. 
      Analyses compared psychometric properties of the QoL measures (reliability of PROMIS 
      short-forms, correlations among QoL scores, "known-groups" validity) between 
      non-careless and careless responder groups. Whether person-fit statistics derived 
      from PROMIS measures accurately discriminated careless and non-careless responders 
      was also examined. RESULTS: About 7.4% of participants were classified as careless 
      responders. No substantial differences in the reliability of PROMIS measures between 
      non-careless and careless responder groups were observed. However, careless 
      responding meaningfully and significantly affected the correlations among QoL 
      domains, as well as the magnitude of differences in QoL between medical and 
      disability groups (presence or absence of disability, depression diagnosis, chronic 
      pain diagnosis). Person-fit statistics significantly and moderately distinguished 
      between non-careless and careless responders. CONCLUSIONS: The results support the 
      importance of identifying and screening out careless responders to ensure 
      high-quality self-report data in Internet-based QoL research.

TI  - What is the evidence that people with frailty have needs for palliative care at the 
      end of life? A systematic review and narrative synthesis.
PG  - 399-414
LID - 10.1177/0269216319828650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of older people living and dying with frailty is rising, but 
      our understanding of their end-of-life care needs is limited. AIM: To synthesise 
      evidence on the end-of-life care needs of people with frailty. DESIGN: Systematic 
      review of literature and narrative synthesis. Protocol registered prospectively with 
      PROSPERO (CRD42016049506). DATA SOURCES: Fourteen electronic databases (CINAHL, 
      Cochrane, Embase, EThOS, Google, Medline, NDLTD, NHS Evidence, NICE, Open grey, 
      Psychinfo, SCIE, SCOPUS and Web of Science) searched from inception to October 2017 
      and supplemented with bibliographic screening and reference chaining. Studies were 
      included if they used an explicit definition or measure of frailty. Quality was 
      assessed using the National Institute for Health tool for observational studies. 
      RESULTS: A total of 4,998 articles were retrieved. Twenty met the inclusion 
      criteria, providing evidence from 92,448 individuals (18,698 with frailty) across 
      seven countries. Thirteen different measures or definitions of frailty were used. 
      People with frailty experience pain and emotional distress at levels similar to 
      people with cancer and also report a range of physical and psychosocial needs, 
      including weakness and anxiety. Functional support needs were high and were highest 
      where people with frailty were cognitively impaired. Individuals with frailty often 
      expressed a preference for reduced intervention, but these preferences were not 
      always observed at critical phases of care. CONCLUSION: People with frailty have 
      varied physical and psychosocial needs at the end of life that may benefit from 
      palliative care. Frailty services should be tailored to patient and family needs and 
      preferences at the end of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain causes greater pain intensity and worse quality of life 
      than nociceptive pain. There are no published data that confirm this in the cancer 
      population. AIM: We hypothesised that patients with neuropathic cancer pain had more 
      intense pain, experienced greater suffering and were treated with more analgesics 
      than those with nociceptive cancer pain, and a neuropathic pain screening tool, 
      painDETECT, would perform as well in those with cancer pain as is reported in those 
      with non-cancer pain. DESIGN: The data were obtained from an international 
      cross-sectional observational study. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1051 patients 
      from inpatients and outpatients, with incurable cancer completed a computerised 
      assessment on symptoms, function and quality of life. In all, 17 centres within 
      eight countries participated. Medical data were recorded by physicians. Pain type 
      was a clinical diagnosis recorded on the Edmonton Classification System for Cancer 
      Pain. RESULTS: Of the patients, 670 had pain: 534 with nociceptive pain, 113 with 
      neuropathic pain and 23 were unclassified. Patients with neuropathic cancer pain 
      were significantly more likely to be receiving oncological treatment, strong opioids 
      and adjuvant analgesia and have a reduced performance status. They reported worse 
      physical, cognitive and social function. Sensitivity and specificity of painDETECT 
      for identifying neuropathic cancer pain was less accurate than when used in 
      non-cancer populations. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropathic cancer pain is associated with a 
      negative impact on daily living and greater analgesic requirements than nociceptive 
      cancer pain. Validated assessment methods are needed to enable early identification 
      of neuropathic cancer pain, leading to more appropriate treatment and reduced burden 
      on patients.

TI  - Palliating delirium in patients with cancer.
PG  - 164-72
LID - 10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70018-X [doi]
AB  - Delirium is a frequent complication in oncology. Its definition as a disorder of 
      consciousness, attention, and cognition is useful to elaborate a rational framework 
      of its pathophysiology and to interpret the role of different aetiological factors 
      and therapeutic interventions. Many aetiologies and an interaction between risk and 
      predisposing factors have been shown to contribute to most cases of delirium. A 
      screening of potential aetiologies is always mandatory to benefit reversible cases. 
      The palliative treatment of symptoms of delirium includes non-pharmacological, 
      environmental, and preventive interventions and the use of haloperidol. If 
      haloperidol fails to control delirium, sedation with other drugs can be necessary. 
      Specific attention to the qualitative aspects of care and to the effect of delirium 
      on family members should be given in the overall assessment of the patient in his or 
      her cancer trajectory.

BTI - Delirium: Screening, Prevention, and Diagnosis – A Systematic Review of the Evidence
AB  - Delirium is a common syndrome in hospitalized or institutionalized adults. It is 
      characterized by the acute onset of altered mental status, hallmarked by difficulty 
      sustaining attention and a fluctuating course. Delirium frequently causes patients, 
      families, and health care providers considerable distress. The incidence varies 
      widely based on patient population, setting, and intensity of diagnostic 
      ascertainment with reported values of 10% to over 80%. Delirium is associated with 
      multiple serious outcomes including increased morbidity, length of hospital stay, 
      healthcare costs, institutionalization, and mortality. In surgical settings, older 
      adults and those with multiple medical conditions are at increased risk for 
      postoperative delirium. Delirium may be under-recognized by healthcare providers and 
      it can be difficult to resolve. Several brief “bedside” questionnaires and 
      checklists exist that can help detect delirium earlier and among those with milder 
      symptoms. Additionally, efforts to prevent the development of delirium in those at 
      risk have been advocated. Medications (including sedatives, narcotics, and 
      anticholinergic drugs), diseases and intercurrent illnesses (e.g., stroke, 
      infection, shock, anemia), surgical procedures (especially orthopedic and cardiac 
      surgery), and environmental factors (e.g., use of a bladder catheter, pain, and 
      emotional stress) are all associated with delirium. Therefore, identifying and 
      implementing effective strategies to prevent and detect delirium could improve 
      clinical outcomes and resource utilization. Suggested strategies to prevent delirium 
      include avoidance of psychoactive medications, pharmacologic interventions to 
      decrease risk, and single- or multi-component non-pharmacologic interventions 
      (including use of music, mobilization, fluid and nutrition management, and 
      orientation and cognitive stimulation). This review was undertaken to evaluate the 
      effectiveness of screening for delirium, the effectiveness and harms of strategies 
      to prevent delirium, and the comparative diagnostic accuracy of tools used to detect 
      delirium.

TI  - Investigating the Relationship of the Functional Gait Assessment to Spatiotemporal 
      Parameters of Gait and Quality of Life in Individuals With Stroke.
PG  - 256-264
LID - 10.1519/JPT.0000000000000173 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Walking in the community is an important aspect of 
      independence and quality of life (QOL) that poses challenges for individuals with 
      stroke. This study investigated whether performance on the Functional Gait 
      Assessment (FGA) differentiated spatiotemporal gait parameters, QOL, and fall 
      history of community-ambulating individuals with stroke. We hypothesized that those 
      scoring higher on the FGA would present with better gait speed and cadence, stride 
      width and length, and improved load time on the paretic limb, report a higher QOL, 
      and be less likely to have a fall history than those who scored lower on the FGA. 
      METHODS: Participants were screened for cognitive impairment and the ability to walk 
      independently. Participant demographics and stroke characteristics were recorded. 
      The Falls Risk for Older People in the Community (FROP-Com) screening tool 
      determined whether the participant had incurred 1 or more falls within the preceding 
      12 months. The FGA provided a composite measure of gait with varied walking tasks 
      challenging different aspects of walking. The total score was recorded. The GAITRite 
      instrumented-walkway was used to acquire high-resolution footfall data during 
      performance of the first 9 FGA walking tasks. The Assessment of Quality of Life-6D 
      (AQoL-6D) was used to measure health-related QOL across the domains of independent 
      living, mental health, coping, relationships, pain, and senses. Pearson and Spearman 
      correlations were used to check for correlations between FGA score and the 
      demographic characteristics, AQoL-6D scores, and 12-month fall history. Pearson 
      correlations were used to check for correlations between FGA score and multiple 
      spatiotemporal gait parameters for each FGA item. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: A sample 
      of 29 volunteers who were community-ambulating individuals with stroke was 
      recruited. Participants had a mean age of 62.31 (10.89) years, mean time since 
      stroke of 3.78 (4.10) years, and included both males and females (52% male). 
      Individuals presented with both left- and right-sided strokes. FGA score correlated 
      positively with velocity, cadence, and step length, and negatively with stride 
      width, double-support percent, and single-support variability (P = .001 to P = 
      .031). FGA score correlated positively with the AQoL-6D dimension of independent 
      living. FGA score correlated significantly with the FROP-Com screening tool 
      predicted fall risk, but not with fall history. CONCLUSIONS: The FGA is a clinical 
      measure of functional gait performance that reflected spatiotemporal gait parameters 
      and ability of individuals with chronic stroke to live independently. The FGA could 
      be used to target interventions to improve functional gait performance of 
      individuals with chronic stroke.

PG  - 435-441
LID - 10.1037/rep0000099 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVE: To investigate the feasibility of brain-computer interface (BCI) 
      with patients on an inpatient spinal cord injury (SCI) unit. Research Method/Design: 
      This study included 25 participants aged 18-64 who sustained traumatic or 
      nontraumatic SCI and did not have severe cognitive or psychiatric impairment. 
      Participants completed a variety of screening measures related to cognition, 
      psychological disposition, pain, and technology experience/interest. The Emotiv 
      electroencephalography system was used in conjunction with a cube rotation and 
      manipulation game presented on a laptop computer. RESULTS: The majority of 
      participants successfully completed the BCI game and reported enjoyment of the 
      experience. Outside of a mild trend of lower performance among participants with a 
      past or present head injury, there were no demographic variables, injury variables 
      or screening measures significantly associated with BCI performance. 
      CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The BCI paradigm demonstrated feasibility and safety 
      across participant age range, educational and vocational background, and level of 
      injury. Despite the rapid integration of technology into rehabilitation health care 
      settings, there are few evidence-based studies regarding the feasibility of 
      technology with specific inpatient populations. Clinical implications and challenges 
      of using this technology in a rehabilitation setting are discussed. (PsycINFO

TI  - Neuropsychological function is related to irritable bowel syndrome in women with 
      premenstrual syndrome and dysmenorrhea.
PG  - 915-923
LID - 10.1007/s00404-020-05659-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence demonstrating the co-occurrence of primary 
      dysmenorrhea (PD), premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) 
      in women. This study aimed to investigate whether women who have symptoms of IBS in 
      addition to PD and PMS also report more severe or frequent menstruation-associated 
      symptoms and psychological complications compared to women with PD and PMS alone. 
      METHODS: The study group included 182 female University students aged 18-25 years. 
      IBS was diagnosed using the Rome III criteria. The severity of PMS and PD was 
      determined using a 10-point visual analog scale and PSST (Premenstrual Syndrome 
      Screening Tool), respectively. Neuropsychological functions including cognitive 
      function, depression score, anxiety score, stress, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, 
      quality of life and personality were assessed using standard questionnaires. 
      RESULTS: Of the 182 young females, 31 (17.0%) had IBS. Average days of bleeding 
      during the menstrual cycle and mean pain severity on the PSST scale were 
      significantly greater in the group with IBS compared to the non-IBS group 
      (p < 0.01). The non-IBS individuals scored more favorably than the women with IBS 
      with respect to severity of depression, insomnia, daytime sleepiness (p < 0.05). The 
      PSST scores were significantly correlated with scores for depression (r = 0.29; 
      p < 0.001), anxiety (r = 0.28; p < 0.001), stress (r = 0.32; p < 0.001), insomnia 
      (r = 0.34; p < 0.001) and daytime sleepiness (r = 0.31; p < 0.001); while, they were 
      negatively correlated with cognitive abilities (r = - 0.20; p = 0.006) and quality 
      of life (r = - 0.42; p < 0.001). Linear regression analysis showed that the PSST 
      scores were possibly significant factors in determining the scores for depression, 
      anxiety, stress, quality of life, insomnia and daytime sleepiness (p < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: IBS is related to psychological comorbidities, in particular depression, 
      sleep problems and menstrual-associated disorders. IBS may exacerbate the features 
      of PMS which should be taken into account in the management of PMS.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our body experience is organized at twofold levels: perceptual and 
      cognitive-emotional. These higher-order processes are clearly different from the 
      primary sensory processing of somatic stimuli (somatosensation). However, most of 
      the available studies have mainly investigated the mechanisms of somatosensation. 
      Moreover, disturbances of our body experience have been documented in some 
      pathological conditions of interest for rehabilitative interventions, but their 
      clinical role and relevance is yet to be clarified. Because in this field we have 
      limited knowledge on perceptual and cognitive body experience, there emerges a need 
      to better clarify this matter. The aim of the present scoping review is to 
      systematically map this topic and to examine the magnitude and the nature of the 
      available evidences. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The scoping review will be performed 
      following the six-stage methodology suggested by Arksey and O'Malley. Ten electronic 
      databases will be investigated since their inception. The search strategy will be 
      peer reviewed by PRESS 2015 Evidence-Based Checklist as a quality assurance step. 
      All records retrieved will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Population, 
      Concept, and Context method will be adopted for eligibility criteria and Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses will be used for results 
      reporting. Two reviewers with different background will perform the search process 
      independently. One author will extract data, checked by a second reviewer checking 
      the matching with the research questions and goals. Any disagreements will be solved 
      by a third reviewer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval is not required for 
      scoping reviews. Dissemination will include submission to peer-reviewed journal and 
      presentations in conferences in the area of rehabilitation.

AB  - Immobility of patients in intensive care units (ICU) can lead to long-lasting 
      physical and cognitive decline. During the last few years, bundles for 
      rehabilitation were developed, including early mobilization. The German guideline 
      for positioning therapy and mobilization, in general, recommends the development of 
      ICU-specific protocols. The aim of this narrative review is to provide guidance when 
      developing a best practice protocol in one's own field of work. It is recommended to 
      a) implement early mobilization as part of a bundle, including screening and 
      management of patient's awareness, pain, anxiety, stress, delirium and family's 
      presence, b) develop a traffic-light system of specific in- and exclusion criteria 
      in an interprofessional process, c) use checklists to assess risks and preparation 
      of mobilization, d) use the ICU Mobility Scale for targeting and documentation of 
      mobilization, e) use relative safety criteria for hemodynamic and respiratory 
      changes, and Borg Scale for subjective evaluation, f) document and evaluate 
      systematically mobilization levels, barriers, unwanted safety events and other 
      parameters.

AB  - Several nutraceuticals have been investigated for preventing or retarding the 
      progression of different neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD). Because Nigella sativa (NS) and its isolated compound thymoquinone (TQ) have 
      significant anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory proprieties, they could represent 
      effective neuroprotective agents. The purpose of this manuscript is to analyze and 
      to recapitulate the results of in vitro and in vivo studies on the potential role of 
      NS/TQ in AD's prevention and treatment. The level of evidence for each included 
      animal study has been assessed by using a modified CAMARADES (Collaborative Approach 
      to Meta-Analysis and Review of Animal Data from Experimental Studies) 10-item 
      checklist. We used MEDLINE and EMBASE databases to screen relevant articles 
      published up to July 2017. A manual search was also performed. The database search 
      yielded 38 studies, of which 18 were included in this manuscript. Results from these 
      approaches suggest that NS or TQ could represent an effective strategy against AD 
      due to the balancing of oxidative processes and the binding to specific 
      intracellular targets. The overall effects mainly regard the prevention of 
      hippocampal pyramidal cell loss and the increased cognitive functions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study is designed to determine whether a full randomised 
      controlled trial (RCT) examining the clinical effectiveness and safety of total knee 
      replacement surgery with or without a tourniquet is warranted and feasible. METHOD 
      AND ANALYSIS: Single centre, patient-blinded and assessor-blinded RCT. A 
      computer-generated randomisation service will allocate 50 participants into one of 
      two trial treatments, surgery with or without a tourniquet. The primary objective is 
      to estimate recruitment, crossovers and follow-up of patients. All patients will 
      have an MRI scan of their brain preoperatively and day 1 or 2 postoperatively to 
      identify ischaemic cerebral emboli (primary clinical outcome). Oxford Cognitive 
      Screen, Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-Mental State Examination will be 
      evaluated as outcome tools for measuring cognitive impairment at days 1, 2 and 7 
      postoperatively. Thigh pain, blood transfusion requirements, venous thromboembolism, 
      revision surgery, surgical complications, mortality and Oxford knee and five-level 
      EuroQol-5D scores will be collected over 12 months. Integrated qualitative research 
      study: 30 trial patients and 20 knee surgeons will take part in semistructured 
      interviews. Interviews will capture views regarding the pilot trial and explore 
      barriers and potential solutions to a full trial. Multicentre cohort study: UK 
      National Joint Registry data will be linked to Hospital Episode Statistics to 
      estimate the relationship between tourniquet use and venous thromboembolic event, 
      length of hospital stay, risk of revision surgery and death. The study will conclude 
      with a multidisciplinary workshop to reach a consensus on whether a full trial is 
      warranted and feasible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: National Research Ethics Committee 
      (West Midlands-Edgbaston) approved this study on 27 January 2016 (15/WM/0455). The 
      study is sponsored by University of Warwick and University Hospitals Coventry and 
      Warwickshire. The results will be disseminated via high-impact peer-reviewed 
      publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN20873088; Pre-results.

TI  - Testosterone and Resting State Connectivity of the Parahippocampal Gyrus in Men With 
      History of Deployment-Related Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.
PG  - e1750-e1758
LID - 10.1093/milmed/usaa142 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of low 
      testosterone level on whole-brain resting state (RS) connectivity in male veterans 
      with symptoms such as sleep disturbance, fatiguability, pain, anxiety, irritability, 
      or aggressiveness persisting after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Follow-up 
      analyses were performed to determine if sleep scores affected the results. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: In our cross-sectional design study, RS magnetic resonance imaging 
      scans on 28 veterans were performed, and testosterone, sleep quality, mood, and 
      post-traumatic stress symptoms were measured. For each participant, we computed the 
      average correlation of each voxel's time-series with the rest of the voxels in the 
      brain, then used AFNI's 3dttest++ on the group data to determine whether the effects 
      of testosterone level on whole-brain connectivity were significant. We then 
      performed follow-up region of interest-based RS analyses of testosterone, with and 
      without sleep quality as a covariate. The study protocol was approved by the 
      National Institute of Health's Combined Neuroscience Institutional Review Board. 
      RESULTS: Sixteen participants reported repeated blast exposure in theater, leading 
      to symptoms; the rest reported exposure to a single blast or a nonblast TBI. 
      Thirty-three percent had testosterone levels <300 ng/dL. Testosterone level was 
      lower in participants who screened positive for post-traumatic stress disorder 
      compared to those who screened negative, but it did not reach statistical 
      significance. Whole-brain connectivity and testosterone level were positively 
      correlated in the left parahippocampal gyrus (LPhG), especially in its connectivity 
      with frontal areas, the lingual gyrus, cingulate, insula, caudate, and right 
      parahippocampal gyrus. Further analysis revealed that the effect of testosterone on 
      LPhG connectivity is only partially mediated by sleep quality. Sleep quality by 
      itself had an effect on connectivity of the thalamus, cerebellum, precuneus, and 
      posterior cingulate. CONCLUSION: Lower testosterone levels were correlated with 
      lower connectivity of the LPhG. Weaknesses of this study include a retrospective 
      design based on self-report of mTBI and the lack of a control group without TBI. 
      Without a control group or pre-injury testosterone measures, we were not able to 
      attribute the rate of low testosterone in our participants to TBI per se. Also 
      testosterone levels were checked only once. The high rate of low testosterone level 
      that we found suggests there may be an association between low testosterone level 
      and greater post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms following deployment, but the 
      causality of the relationships between TBI and deployment stress, testosterone 
      level, behavioral symptomatology, and LPhG connectivity remains to be determined. 
      Our study on men with persistent symptoms postdeployment and post-mTBI may help us 
      understand the role of low testosterone and sleep quality in persistent symptoms and 
      may be important in developing therapeutic interventions. Our results highlight the 
      role of the LPhG, as we found that whole-brain connectivity in that region was 
      positively associated with testosterone level, with only a limited portion of that 
      effect attributable to sleep quality.

TI  - Patients' experience of shoulder disorders: a systematic review of qualitative 
      studies for the OMERACT Shoulder Core Domain Set.

LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/kez046 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the experiences (including symptoms and perceived impacts on 
      daily living) of people with a shoulder disorder. METHODS: Systematic review of 
      qualitative studies. We searched for eligible qualitative studies indexed in Ovid 
      MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, CINAHL (EBSCO), SportDiscus (EBSCO) and Ovid PsycINFO up until 
      November 2017. Two authors independently screened studies for inclusion, appraised 
      their methodological quality using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme 
      checklist, used thematic synthesis methods to generate themes describing the 
      experiences reported by participants and assessed the confidence in the findings 
      using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation 
      Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual) 
      approach. RESULTS: The inclusion criteria were met by eight studies, which included 
      133 participants (49 females and 84 males) with either rotator cuff disease, 
      adhesive capsulitis, proximal humeral fracture, shoulder instability or unspecified 
      shoulder pain. We generated seven themes to describe what people in the included 
      studies reported experiencing: pain; physical function/activity limitations; 
      participation restriction; sleep disruption; cognitive dysfunction; emotional 
      distress; and other pathophysiological manifestations (other than pain). There were 
      interactions between the themes, with particular experiences impacting on others 
      (e.g. pain leading to reduced activities and sleep disruption). Following grading of 
      the evidence, we considered it likely that most of the review findings were a 
      reasonable representation of the experiences of people with shoulder disorders. 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with shoulder disorders contend with considerable disruption to 
      their life. The experiences described should be considered by researchers seeking to 
      select the most appropriate outcomes to measure in clinical trials and other 
      research studies in people with shoulder disorders.

TI  - Central sensitization in patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature 
      review.
PG  - 556-67
LID - 10.1016/j.semarthrit.2011.08.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study is to systematically review the scientific 
      literature addressing central sensitization and central nociceptive processing in 
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: To identify relevant articles, we 
      searched PubMed and Web of Science. The search strategy was a combination of terms 
      of the following groups: "Rheumatoid arthritis," inflammatory joint pain, or 
      arthritis; AND (central) sensitization, (central) hypersensitivity, central 
      hyperexcitability, pain modulation, pain processing, neural inhibition, or pain 
      physiopathology; AND pain, nociception, hyperalgesia, pain threshold, or algometry. 
      Articles fulfilling the inclusion criteria were screened for methodologic quality 
      with specific checklists to evaluate different study designs (2 independent raters). 
      RESULTS: Twenty-four full-text articles were included, of which the majority were 
      case-control studies, followed by nonsystematic reviews, cross-sectional studies, 
      and case reports. Methodologic quality was very heterogeneous. Preliminary evidence 
      for generalized hyperalgesia in RA is available. In addition, the mechanism behind 
      impaired central nociceptive processing remains rather obscure. The role of 
      cytokines and neuropeptides especially remains to be elucidated. Windup appears to 
      develop more easily in RA, but evidence in support of impaired nociceptive 
      inhibition and cognitive emotional sensitization (sensitization due to cognitive 
      bias) is scarce. CONCLUSIONS: The symmetrical manifestation of the disease, the poor 
      relation between disease activity and symptoms, and the generalized hyperalgesia at 
      both articular and nonarticular sites for different kinds of stimuli are indicative 
      of the presence of central sensitization in RA patients. Further research is 
      required to provide firm evidence in support of various aspects of central 
      sensitization in humans with RA.

TI  - Review of self-reported instruments that measure sleep dysfunction in patients 
      suffering from temporomandibular disorders and/or orofacial pain.

AB  - Patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) and/or orofacial pain (OFP) 
      frequently experience poor sleep quality or suffer from comorbid sleep disorders. 
      Study results suggest that in chronic pain patients, an improvement in sleep quality 
      critically influences the outcomes of interventions on mood and pain. Yet, only a 
      few studies have systematically sought to evaluate the sleep quality of TMD/OFP 
      patients. Standardized and validated self-reported instruments designed for 
      screening sleep disturbances or for the evaluation of treatment outcomes in this 
      population would therefore enhance evidence and improve treatment options. The 
      objectives of the present study were: (1) to review the self-reported instruments 
      that measure sleep dysfunction in studies on TMD/OFP patients, by conducting a 
      systematic literature search; (2) to evaluate their clinimetric evidence; and (3) to 
      provide guidance for future research using such instruments. A total of 26 papers, 
      using eight different instruments, were identified. The most frequently used 
      questionnaires and the only ones with good clinimetric properties were the Insomnia 
      Severity Index followed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and the Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale. They were most reliable, valid and time-effective for measuring 
      sleep dysfunctions in patients with TMD/OFP, with only a few practical constraints. 
      Yet, in future studies, an assessment of the relationship between sleep disturbances 
      and chronic pain will have to include instruments measuring the effect of mediator 
      variables such as cognitive or emotional arousal. Research is required to clarify if 
      existing self-reported questionnaires measuring these aspects will promote further 
      insights or if there is a need for new instruments. This future research direction 
      would blend into the overall biopsychosocial concept of TMD/OFP diagnoses and 
      treatment.

TI  - The Effect of Insomnia on Neuropsychological Functioning in Patients with Comorbid 
      Symptoms of Pain, Fatigue, and Mood Disorders.
PG  - 14-23
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acx040 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine if elevated symptoms of insomnia affects neuropsychological 
      functioning in patients with concurrent symptoms of pain, fatigue, and mood 
      disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of seventy-six subjects participated in this 
      (cross-sectional) study. Based on the cut-off score guidelines from The Insomnia 
      Severity Index subjects were assigned to either a clinical insomnia group (N = 35) 
      or a comparison group (N = 41). Factors such as age, general cognitive functioning, 
      and symptoms of pain, fatigue, depression, and anxiety did not differ between the 
      groups. Both groups completed a questionnaire which assessed subjective memory 
      functioning. In addition they completed a set of neuropsychological tests measuring 
      general cognitive functioning, spatial and verbal working memory, and inhibitory 
      control. Although the subjects with clinical insomnia did not report more memory 
      problems than the comparison group, they presented significant deficiencies on the 
      tests assessing spatial and verbal working memory. There was no difference between 
      the groups in inhibitory control. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that as the symptom 
      severity of insomnia increases and become clinically significant, it has substantial 
      effect on both spatial and verbal-numeric working memory functioning. By 
      differentiating and testing different domains of working memory, this study provides 
      a more detailed and nuanced characterization of working memory deficiencies than the 
      previous studies within this field. The results need to be transferred to clinical 
      practice so that neuropsychologists include assessments of sleep as part of their 
      routine screenings.

TI  - Enhanced Neural Empathic Responses in Patients with Spino-Bulbar Muscular Atrophy: 
      An Electrophysiological Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci11010016 [doi]
LID - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Spino-bulbar muscular atrophy is a rare genetic X-linked disease caused 
      by testosterone insensitivity. An inverse correlation has been described between 
      testosterone levels and empathic responses. The present study explored the profile 
      of neural empathic responding in spino-bulbar muscular atrophy patients. METHODS: 
      Eighteen patients with spino-bulbar muscular atrophy and eighteen healthy male 
      controls were enrolled in the study. Their event-related potentials were recorded 
      during an "Empathy Task" designed to distinguish neural responses linked with 
      experience-sharing (early response) and mentalizing (late response) components of 
      empathy. The task involved the presentation of contextual information (painful vs. 
      neutral sentences) and facial expressions (painful vs. neutral). An explicit 
      dispositional empathy-related questionnaire was also administered to all 
      participants, who were screened via neuropsychological battery tests that did not 
      reveal potential cognitive deficits. Due to electrophysiological artefacts, data 
      from 12 patients and 17 controls were finally included in the analyses. RESULTS: 
      Although patients and controls did not differ in terms of dispositional, explicit 
      empathic self-ratings, notably conservative event-related potentials analyses (i.e., 
      spatio-temporal permutation cluster analyses) showed a significantly greater 
      experience-sharing neural response in patients compared to healthy controls in the 
      Empathy-task when both contextual information and facial expressions were painful. 
      CONCLUSION: The present study contributes to the characterization of the 
      psychological profile of patients with spino-bulbar muscular atrophy, highlighting 
      the peculiarities in enhanced neural responses underlying empathic reactions.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic disease characterized by 
      diffuse pain of unknown cause, fatigue, sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and 
      sensitivity. Fibromyalgia was shown to be associated with balance problems and 
      increased incidence of falls. There are many theoretical mechanisms related to the 
      impact of vitamin D on postural control. The aim of the current study was to 
      investigate the relationship between vitamin 25(OH)D levels and pain, balance and 
      daily activities in patients with FMS. METHOD: Patients aged 35-65 years who were 
      diagnosed with FMS according to 1990 ACR diagnostic criteria were screened. Seventy 
      patients diagnosed with FMS and 60 healthy controls with comparable age and gender 
      were included in the study. Fibromyalgia impact scale (FIQ), Berg Balance Scale 
      (BBS), the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP), and visual analog scale (VAS) were 
      applied to the subjects. The subjects were divided into two groups by vitamin 
      25(OH)D level being above or below 30 ng/ml. RESULTS: A statistically significant 
      difference was established between VAS, BBS value and all NHP subscale and NHP total 
      values of FMS patients and those of healthy control group. The relationship between 
      BBS and the level of vitamin 25(OH)D of all participants was investigated, a 
      positive statistically significant relationship was found with Vit-D at r = 0.481 
      level (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: It was observed that low vitamin D levels affected 
      balance in both FMS group and healthy control group. It should be kept in mind that 
      vitamin D level is likely to negatively affect balance and VAS values in FMS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the impact on quality of life from 
      informing patients with cancer of their diagnosis and disease status. METHOD: We 
      searched the follow databases, PubMed, CENTRAL (Cochrane Central Register of 
      Controlled Trials), PsycINFO, WEB OF SCIENCE, Embase, CBM (Chinese Biomedical 
      Literature database), WANFANG database (Chinese Medicine Premier), and CNKI (China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure), using the following terms: neoplasm, cancer, 
      tumor, tumor, carcinoma, disclosure, truth telling, breaking bad news, knowledge, 
      knowing, awareness, quality of life, QOL. Pairs of reviewers independently screened 
      documents and extracted the data, and the meta-analysis was performed using Revman 
      5.0 software. RESULTS: Eleven thousand seven hundred forty records retrieved from 
      the databases and 23 studies were included in the final analysis. A meta-analysis 
      revealed that there were no differences in either the general quality of life and 
      symptoms of fatigue, pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, and diarrhea, between 
      informed and uniformed cancer patients (P > 0.05). There were also no differences 
      found between the patient groups in physical function, role function, cognitive 
      activity, and emotional function (P > 0.05). In terms of vitality, patients who were 
      completely informed about their diagnosis showed higher vitality than uniformed 
      patients. Uninformed patients seemed to have lower social function scores. Between 
      partly informed and uninformed cancer patients, no differences were found in their 
      general quality of life, function domains, and disease-related symptoms (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Informing cancer patients of their diagnosis may not have a detrimental 
      effect on their quality of life. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CRD42017060073 .

TI  - Applicability of the 48/6 Model of Care as a Health Screening Tool, and its 
      Association with Mobility in Community-Dwelling Older Adults.
PG  - e43

AB  - BACKGROUND: The 48/6 Model of Care is an integrative care initiative for improving 
      the health outcomes of hospitalized older patients; however, its applicability in 
      community-dwelling older adults as a health screening tool has not been 
      investigated. The present study aimed to examine the applicability of this model, 
      prevalence of dysfunction in 6 care areas, and its relationship with self-reported 
      mobility in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional 
      survey study of community-dwelling adults aged 65 or older. Participants were 
      screened for problems using 9 items corresponding to the 6 care areas of the 48/6 
      Model of Care (cognitive functioning, functional mobility, pain management, 
      nutrition and hydration, bladder and bowel management, and medication management). 
      Mobility was assessed via the Life-Space Assessment (LSA). We examined the 
      correlation between each screening item and the LSA. RESULTS: A total of 444 older 
      adults (260 women, 58.6%) participated. The mean number of health problems was 2.3 ± 
      2.1, with the most common being pain, cognitive impairment, and urinary 
      incontinence. These problems and LSA scores were significantly different by age 
      groups. A multiple regression analysis showed that polypharmacy (β = -10.567, P < 
      0.001), dysphagia (β = -9.610, P = 0.021), and pain (β = -7.369, P = 0.004) were 
      significantly associated with life-space mobility after controlling for age. 
      CONCLUSION: The 48/6 Model of Care is applicable to community-dwelling older adults, 
      who show high prevalence of dysfunction in the 6 care areas. This study supports the 
      role of the model in screening for the health status of older adults living in the 
      community, and in estimating mobility.

TI  - The Perceptions of Trauma, Complaints, Somatization, and Coping Strategies among 
      Syrian Refugees in Germany-A Qualitative Study of an At-Risk Population.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph17030693 [doi]
LID - 693
AB  - Background: A high prevalence of mental distress, especially posttraumatic stress 
      disorder, has been widely confirmed among refugees. In order to establish adequate 
      interventions in psychotherapy, however, it must first be examined whether refugees 
      have similar ideas and concepts of stress, trauma, and healing. This study, 
      therefore, aimed to analyze the representations of trauma, self-reported complaints, 
      indications of somatization, and coping strategies among a refugee population. 
      Methods: Semi-structured interviews based on the Cultural Formulation Interview 
      (CFI) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) were 
      conducted with Syrian refugees who have residence permission in Germany. The 
      interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed according to the 
      qualitative content analysis of Mayring. The foci of interest were determined on the 
      basis of the predefined interview guideline, and inductive subcategories were 
      extracted from the transcripts. Results: Sixteen refugees participated (50% women; 
      mean age: 35.5 years, SD = 11.2; the mean duration of stay in Germany: 23.3 months, 
      SD = 6.6). War experiences were the most frequently reported subjective perceptions 
      of trauma. Frequently reported complaints included sleeping disturbance, 
      cardiovascular symptoms, rumination, and pain. Among half of the participants, we 
      found indications of somatization. We identified the following coping strategies: 
      Activity, cognitive coping, social coping, religious coping, avoidance, and 
      emotional coping. Conclusions: War-related traumatic events are the most common 
      trauma perceptions among Syrian refugees. The self-reported complaints demonstrate 
      somatoform, depressive, and posttraumatic symptoms. Syrian refugees should be 
      screened for somatization, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder and should 
      receive targeted interventions that consider and support individual coping 
      resources.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence for a systematic relationship between cancer 
      patients' pre-treatment expectations (anticipated side effects) and subsequent 
      experience of treatment-related side effects, and to compare this relationship in 
      patients with no prior treatment experience (cognitive expectations) and with some 
      prior treatment experience (conditioned response). METHODS: A total of 12,952 
      citations were identified through a comprehensive search of the literature published 
      on or before November 2016 and screened against inclusion criteria. Studies were 
      eligible if they included participants undergoing curative treatment for cancer, 
      measured a treatment side effect, examined the relationship between anticipation and 
      experience of side effects, and reported quantitative data. RESULTS: Thirty-one 
      studies were included in the review and meta-analysis (total N = 5069). The side 
      effects examined were nausea (anticipatory and post-treatment), vomiting, fatigue, 
      pain, problems with concentration, and skin reactions. Meta-analyses indicated 
      positive associations between anticipation and subsequent experience for all 
      included side effects in patients with no prior treatment exposure 
      (r = 0.153-0.431). Stronger associations were found for all included side effects in 
      patients with previous treatment experience (r = 0.211-0.476), except for fatigue 
      (r = 0.266) and pain (r = 0.235). No significant differences were found when overall 
      effect sizes for patients with and without prior treatment exposure were compared 
      for each side effect, except for anticipatory nausea (p = 0.012). CONCLUSION: These 
      results may have implications for future interventions that target patients' 
      expectations of cancer treatment-related side effects. Future research could explore 
      patient reports of messages received about likely treatment effects both before and 
      during treatment.

TI  - Efficacy of multimodal analgesic treatment of severe traumatic acute pain in mice 
      pretreated with chronic high dose of buprenorphine inducing mechanical allodynia.

AB  - Managing severe acute nociceptive pain in buprenorphine-maintained individuals for 
      opioid use disorder management is challenging owing to the high affinity and very 
      slow dissociation of buprenorphine from μ-opioid receptors that hinders the use of 
      full agonist opioid analgesics. In a translational approach, the aim of this study 
      was to use an animal setting to investigate the effects of a chronic high dose of 
      buprenorphine treatment on nociceptive thresholds before and after applying a severe 
      acute nociceptive traumatic surgery stimulus and to screen postoperative 
      pharmacological analgesic strategies. A chronic treatment of mice with a high dose 
      of buprenorphine (BUP HD, 2 × 200 μg/kg/day; i.p.) revealed significant mechanical 
      allodynia. One and two days after having discontinued buprenorphine administration 
      and having induced a severe nociceptive acute pain by a closed tibial fracture, 
      acute administration of morphine at a dose which has analgesic effects in absence of 
      pretreatment (4.5 mg/kg; i.p.), was ineffective to reduce pain in the BUP HD group. 
      However, mimicking multimodal analgesia strategy used in human postoperative 
      context, the combination of morphine (administered at the same dose) with a NMDA 
      receptor antagonist (ketamine) or an NSAID (ketoprofen) produced antinociceptive 
      responses in these animals. The mouse model of closed tibial fracture could be 
      useful to identify analgesic strategies of postoperative pain for patients with 
      chronic exposure to opioids and suffering from hyperalgesia.

AB  - Recent behavioral research has shown evidence for greater inclination to avoid 
      symbolic cues of mortality threats in nonbelievers than Christians. However, the 
      neurocognitive mechanisms underlying religious influences on behavioral tendency to 
      avoid mortality threats remain unknown. We tested the hypothesis of distinct 
      arousal/attention-related brain responses to self-related information under 
      mortality in nonbelievers and Christians. We recorded event-related brain potentials 
      (ERPs) from Christians and nonbelievers while they viewed their own names and a 
      stranger's name (i.e., Zuma) that flashed around a cue word (i.e., death, pain or 
      life) located at the center of a screen. While own name vs. a stranger's name 
      induced faster responses and larger P3 amplitudes, the P3 amplitudes to own name 
      showed distinct patterns of modulations by the cue words in nonbelievers and 
      Christians. Specifically, own name elicited larger P3 amplitudes in the death than 
      pain/life cue conditions in nonbelievers but not in Christians. Moreover, the 
      differential P3 amplitude to own names in the death vs. life cue conditions 
      predicted greater inclination to avoid mortality threats in nonbelievers but not in 
      Christians. Our findings provide a neurocognitive account of increased behavioral 
      tendency to avoid mortality threats in nonbelievers than in Christians.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The CHARIOT PRO Main study is a prospective, non-interventional study 
      evaluating cognitive trajectories in participants at the preclinical stage of 
      Alzheimer's disease (AD) classified by risk levels for developing mild cognitive 
      impairment due to AD (MCI-AD). OBJECTIVES: The study aimed to characterize factors 
      and markers influencing cognitive and functional progression among individuals 
      at-risk for developing MCI-AD, and examine data for more precise predictors of 
      cognitive change, particularly in relation to APOE ε4 subgroup. DESIGN: This 
      single-site study was conducted at the Imperial College London (ICL) in the United 
      Kingdom. Participants 60 to 85 years of age were classified as high, medium 
      (amnestic or non-amnestic) or low risk for developing MCI-AD based on RBANS 
      z-scores. A series of clinical outcome assessments (COAs) on factors influencing 
      baseline cognitive changes were collected in each of the instrument categories of 
      cognition, lifestyle exposure, mood, and sleep. Data collection was planned to occur 
      every 6 months for 48 months, however the median follow-up time was 18.1 months due 
      to early termination of study by the sponsor. RESULTS: 987 participants were 
      screened, among them 690 participants were actively followed-up post baseline, of 
      whom 165 (23.9%) were APOE ε4 carriers; with at least one copy of the allele. The 
      mean age was 68.73 years, 94.6% were white, 57.4% were female, and 34.8% had a 
      Family History of Dementia with a somewhat larger percentage in the APOE ε4 carrier 
      group (42.4%) compared to the non-carrier group (32.4%). Over half of the 
      participants were married and 53% had a Bachelor's or higher degree. Most 
      frequently, safety events typical for this population consisted of upper respiratory 
      tract infection (10.4%), falls (5.2%), hypertension (3.5%) and back pain (3.0%). 
      Conclusion (clinical relevance): AD-related measures collected during the CHARIOT 
      PRO Main study will allow identification and evaluation of AD risk factors and 
      markers associated with cognitive performance from the pre-clinical stage. 
      Evaluating the psycho-biological characteristics of these pre-symptomatic 
      individuals in relation to their natural neurocognitive trajectories will enhance 
      current understanding on determinants of the initial signs of cognitive changes 
      linked to AD.

TI  - Cognitive Impairment and Mood States after Spinal Cord Injury.
PG  - 1156-1163

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) is believed to be associated with high rates of cognitive 
      impairment, which can result in complications in recovery. This study concerned two 
      groups of adults with SCI. The first sample involved 150 participants with SCI who 
      were assessed once for cognitive capacity with comparisons made with 45 able-bodied 
      adults. Sample 2 were drawn from Sample 1, and included 88 participants with SCI who 
      were prospectively assessed for mood states (anxiety, depressive mood, and fatigue) 
      and pain intensity at three time periods: at admission to SCI rehabilitation, at 
      discharge, and 6 months after transition into the community. Results showed that the 
      SCI sample had significantly lower cognitive performance than the able-bodied 
      control group. Further, almost 29% of the adults with SCI had lowered cognitive 
      performance believed to be indicative of cognitive impairment. The risk of an adult 
      with SCI having cognitive impairment was almost 13 times that of someone without an 
      SCI. Results from Sample 2 revealed that the development of negative mood states was 
      a significant problem in those with cognitive impairment after they transitioned 
      into the community, a time when personal resources are severely challenged. Findings 
      suggest all adults with SCI admitted to rehabilitation should receive a cognitive 
      screen, and that rehabilitation strategies should then be guided by the cognitive 
      performance of the person. Special attention should also be given to improving 
      skills of those with cognitive impairment before they transition into the community, 
      so as to reduce risk of comorbid mental health problems.

TI  - Incidence and risk factors of postoperative delirium in patients admitted to the ICU 
      after elective intracranial surgery: A prospective cohort study.
PG  - 14-24
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000001074 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) has been confirmed as an important 
      complication after major surgery. However, neurosurgical patients have usually been 
      excluded in previous studies. To date, data on POD and risk factors in patients 
      after intracranial surgery are scarce. OBJECTIVES: To determine the incidence and 
      risk factors of POD in patients after intracranial surgery. DESIGN: Prospective 
      cohort study. SETTING: A neurosurgical ICU of a university-affiliated hospital, 
      Beijing, China. INTERVENTIONS: Adult patients admitted to the ICU after elective 
      intracranial surgery under general anaesthesia were consecutively enrolled between 1 
      March 2017 and 2 February 2018. Delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment 
      Method for the ICU. POD was diagnosed as Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU 
      positive on either postoperative day 1 or day 3. Patients were classified into 
      groups with or without POD. Data were collected for univariate and multivariate 
      analyses to determine the risk factors for POD. RESULTS: A total of 800 patients 
      were included. POD was diagnosed in 157 patients (19.6%, 95% confidence interval 
      16.9 to 22.4%). Independent risk factors for POD included age, nature of 
      intracranial lesion, frontal approach craniotomy, duration of surgery, presence of 
      an episode of low pulse oxygenation at ICU admission, presence of inadequate 
      emergence and emergence delirium, postoperative pain and presence of immobilising 
      events. POD was associated with adverse outcomes and high costs. CONCLUSION: POD is 
      prevalent in patients after elective intracranial surgery. The identified risk 
      factors for and the potential association of POD with adverse outcomes suggest that 
      a comprehensive strategy involving screening for predisposing factors and early 
      prevention of modifiable factors should be established in this population. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and 
      leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common form of hereditary stroke disorder 
      caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. Although CADASIL scale is a widely used tool 
      to screen clinically suspected CADASIL patients, the differential effects of this 
      scale in various populations remain unknown. METHODS: 92 CADASIL-like patients and 
      24 CADASIL patients were selected based on CADASIL scale and gene tests. The 
      clinical, genetic and radiological characteristics were analyzed. RESULTS: Based on 
      the CADASIL scale, we first screened 116 suspected CADASIL patients, and detected 20 
      mutations in 24 CADASIL-patients (Specificity: 20.69 %). Surprisingly, we found that 
      transient ischemic attack/stroke, migraine, cognitive decline, psychiatric 
      disturbances and early onset age in CADASIL scale showed no differences between the 
      CADASIL and the CADASIL-like patients (p > 0.05). Instead, recurrent cerebral 
      ischemic events (58.33 %, p = 0.028) and positive family histories (p < 0.05) were 
      more frequently observed in CADASIL patients. Moreover, compared with CADASIL-like 
      patients (21.74 %), CADASIL patients demonstrated higher percentage of temporal pole 
      involvements (58.33 %, p = 0.001), but not the external capsule involvements (66.67 
      %, p = 0.602), in MRI imaging. Further, we found that vascular risk factors could 
      occur in both CADASIL patients and CADASIL-like patients, and therefore could not be 
      used as the markers to differentiate the two groups in our study (p > 0.05). By 
      performing DSA analysis, we for the first time identified dysplasia of cerebral 
      blood vessels in CADASIL patients, which were detected more frequently in CADASIL 
      patients (41.67 %) in comparison with CADASIL-like patients (8.69 %, p <0.01). 
      CONCLUSION: Our data suggested that the efficacy of CADASIL scale to diagnose the 
      disease varied with specific populations. Recurrent cerebral ischemic events, 
      temporal pole involvements (but not the external capsule) in MRI imaging and 
      dysplasia of cerebral blood vessels in DSA may be the new potential risk factors of 
      the CADASIL scale suitable for Chinese patients. Gene testing by encephalopathy gene 
      panel is expected to improve the accuracy of CADASIL differential diagnosis and 
      increase the understanding of this disease in the future.

AB  - The early detection of cognitive impairment or dementia is in the focus of current 
      research as the amount of cognitively impaired individuals will rise intensely in 
      the next decades due to aging population worldwide. Currently available diagnostic 
      tools to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia are time-consuming, 
      invasive or expensive and not suitable for wide application as required by the high 
      number of people at risk. Thus, a fast, simple and sensitive test is urgently needed 
      to enable an accurate detection of people with cognitive dysfunction and dementia in 
      the earlier stages to initiate specific diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. We 
      examined digital Clock Drawing Test (dCDT) kinematics for their clinical utility in 
      differentiating patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) or mild Alzheimer's dementia (mAD) 
      from healthy controls (HCs) and compared it with the diagnostic value of the 
      Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) 
      neuropsychological battery total score. Data of 381 participants (138 patients with 
      aMCI, 106 patients with mAD and 137 HCs) was analyzed in the present study. All 
      participants performed the clock drawing test (CDT) on a tablet computer and 
      underwent the CERAD test battery and depression screening. CERAD total scores were 
      calculated by subtest summation, excluding MMSE scores. All tablet variables (i.e. 
      time in air, time on surface, total time, velocity, pressure, pressure/velocity 
      relation, strokes per minute, time not painting, pen-up stroke length, 
      pen-up/pen-down relation, and CDT score) during dCDT performance were entered in a 
      forward stepwise logistic regression model to assess, which parameters best 
      discriminated between aMCI or mAD and HC. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) 
      curves were constructed to visualize the specificity in relation to the sensitivity 
      of dCDT variables against CERAD total scores in categorizing the diagnostic groups. 
      dCDT variables provided a slightly better diagnostic accuracy of 81.5% for 
      discrimination of aMCI from HCs than using CERAD total score (accuracy 77.5%). In 
      aMCI patients with normal CDT scores, both dCDT (accuracy 78.0%) and CERAD total 
      scores (accuracy 76.0%) were equally accurate in discriminating against HCs. 
      Finally, in differentiating patients with mAD from healthy individuals, accuracy of 
      both dCDT (93.0%) and CERAD total scores (92.3%) was excellent. Our findings suggest 
      that dCDT is a suitable screening tool to identify early cognitive dysfunction. Its 
      performance is comparable with the time-consuming established psychometric measure 
      (CERAD test battery).

AB  - Objective: Perform systematic literature review on photobiomodulation (PBM) devices 
      used at home for nonesthetic applications. Background: Home-use PBM devices have 
      been marketed for cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. This is the first systematic 
      literature review for nonesthetic applications. Methods: A systematic literature 
      search was conducted for PBM devices self-applied at home at least thrice a week. 
      Two independent reviewers screened the articles and extracted the data. Treatment 
      dosage appropriateness was compared to the World Association for Laser Therapy 
      (WALT) recommendations. The efficacy was evaluated according to the relevant primary 
      end-point for the specific indication. Results: Eleven studies were suitable. 
      Devices were applied for a range of indications, including pain, cognitive 
      dysfunction, wound healing, diabetic macular edema, and postprocedural side effects, 
      and were mostly based on near-infrared, pulsed light-emitting diodes with dosages 
      within WALT recommendations. Regarding efficacy, studies reported mostly positive 
      results. Conclusions: Home-use PBM devices appear to mediate effective, safe 
      treatments in a variety of conditions that require frequent applications. Conclusive 
      evaluation of their efficacy requires additional, randomized controlled studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the associations between dietary patterns in midlife and 
      likelihood of future healthy ageing in Chinese older adults. DESIGN: Prospective 
      population-based study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We included 14,159 participants 
      aged 45-74 years who were free from cancer, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes at 
      baseline (1993-1998) from the Singapore Chinese Health Study. METHODS: Dietary 
      intakes in midlife were assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire at 
      baseline. Diet quality was scored according to the alternate Mediterranean diet 
      (aMED), the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, the alternative 
      Healthy Eating Index (AHEI)-2010, overall plant-based diet index (PDI), and 
      healthful plant-based diet index (hPDI). Healthy ageing was assessed at the third 
      follow-up visit (2014-2016), which occurred about 20 years after the baseline visit, 
      and was defined as the absence of 10 chronic diseases, no impairment of cognitive 
      function, no limitations in instrumental activities of daily living, no clinical 
      depression at screening, good overall self-perceived health, good physical 
      functioning, and no function-limiting pain among participants who had survival to at 
      least 65 years of age. Multivariable-adjusted logistic regression models were 
      applied to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the 
      association between each dietary pattern score and healthy ageing. RESULTS: About 
      20.0% of participants met the healthy ageing criteria. The OR (95% CI) for healthy 
      ageing comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of diet quality scores was 
      1.52 (1.31-1.77) for aMED, 1.53 (1.35-1.73) for DASH, 1.39 (1.23-1.57) for 
      AHEI-2010, 1.34 (1.18-1.53) for PDI, and 1.45 (1.27-1.65) for hPDI (all 
      P-trend < .001). Each standard deviation increment in different diet quality scores 
      was associated with 12% to 18% higher likelihood of healthy ageing. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: In this Chinese population, adherence to various healthy dietary 
      patterns at midlife is associated with higher likelihood of healthy ageing at later 
      life.

AB  - In the broader list of cognitive concerns, neuropsychological testing has shown that 
      attentional impairment may have a specific burden in Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FMS). 
      Preliminary observations have reported a subset of FMS patient screened for 
      attention disorders fulfilling the actual diagnosis of ADHD, a neurodevelopmental 
      disorder characterized by developmentally inadequate levels of inattention, 
      hyperactivity and impulsivity that might persist in adulthood. Yet, no study to date 
      has systematically examined the history and the specific contribution of ADHD to FMS 
      in terms of clinical impact and related specific disabilities. In this study, 106 
      individuals with a FMS diagnosis based on the 2010 criteria of the American College 
      of Rheumatology have been assessed for (a) the presence of ADHD; (b) the burden of 
      disability caused by ADHD versus FMS; (c) the presence of other psychiatric 
      disorders. Results indicated that ADHD was present in 24.5% of FMS individuals, it 
      was associated with higher FMS symptoms severity and a greater functional 
      impairment, particularly in the work/school domain. Moreover, patients with both FMS 
      and ADHD had higher frequency of substance use disorders than those with FMS only 
      (38.5% versus 3.8%) and mainly opioids. Overall, results suggest that ADHD can 
      increase burden adding specific disability in work and social activities, and it is 
      associated with a trend for the excessive use of opioid painkillers. Detection of 
      neurodevelopmental and actual symptoms of ADHD is highly recommended especially in 
      patient prone to increase the dose of anti-pain medication.

TI  - Importance of Geriatric Syndrome Screening within 48 Hours of Hospitalization for 
      Identifying Readmission Risk: A Retrospective Study in an Acute-Care Hospital.
PG  - 83-90
LID - 10.4235/agmr.20.0017 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the association between geriatric syndrome and hospital 
      readmission, we evaluated the suitability of geriatric syndrome screening for care 
      (GSC) in identifying readmission risk and suggested the appropriate time for GSC. 
      METHODS: GSC considering cognitive impairment, depression, polypharmacy (five or 
      more medications), functional mobility, dysphagia, malnutrition, pain, and 
      incontinence was performed among 2,663 general ward inpatients aged 65 years or 
      older within 48 hours after admission and again before discharge between November 
      2016 and October 2017. From each patient, fall events, pressure ulcers, potentially 
      inappropriate medication use, and delirium were assessed at admission. Patients were 
      divided into two groups on the basis of readmission within 1 year after the first 
      admission. According to the screening period (at admission and before discharge) and 
      in-hospital decline, we applied receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to 
      compare the prevalence of clinical concerns between the readmission and 
      no-readmission groups. We also used multiple logistic regression analysis to 
      evaluate the risk of readmission according to the presence of geriatric syndrome and 
      clinical outcomes. RESULTS: The 782 readmitted patients (29.4%) showed a higher rate 
      of poor GSC than those who were not readmitted. Polypharmacy at admission was 
      significantly correlated with readmission risk (area under the receiver operating 
      characteristic curve=0.602). Fall events (odds ratio [OR]=4.36; 95% confidence 
      interval [CI], 2.36-8.05), urinary incontinence (OR=4.21; 95% CI, 3.28-5.39), and 
      depressive mood (OR=3.88; 95% CI, 2.69-5.59) at admission were risk factors for 
      readmission. CONCLUSION: Geriatric syndromes assessed by GSC at admission was 
      associated with an increased risk of readmission.

TI  - Ethnicity predicts falls among community-dwelling older adults in Singapore.
PG  - 72-79
LID - 10.1111/ggi.13143 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The present study examined whether ethnicity independently predicted future 
      falls among community-dwelling older Singaporeans, and whether ethnicity moderated 
      the relationships between falls risk factors at baseline and falls at follow up. 
      METHODS: Data from a longitudinal survey of older Singaporeans were used. Baseline 
      assessment included handgrip strength, global cognitive function, mobility 
      difficulties, health and psychosocial status. One-year retrospective falls 
      information at follow up was the primary outcome. RESULTS: Final analysis included 
      1975 participants (mean age 73.6 ± 6.2 years, 53% women). Indians, followed by 
      Malays, had a higher risk of falling compared with Chinese at follow up. This 
      association remained after controlling for falls risk factors. Self-reported pain 
      and poor global cognitive function imposed a substantial increment in the risk of 
      falling among Malays compared with Chinese, but not Indians. CONCLUSION: Ethnicity 
      was a significant predictor of future falls among older Singaporeans. Falls 
      screening and intervention should take ethnicity into account to reach and support 
      the appropriate target population. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2018; 18: 72-79.

TI  - Electrophysiological correlates of empathic processing and its relation to 
      psychopathic meanness.
PG  - 996-1006
LID - 10.1037/neu0000477 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A lack of empathy and the presence of predatory tendencies are considered 
      key features of psychopathic meanness. Previous electrophysiological studies on 
      empathy in relation to psychopathic traits have focused mainly on empathy for pain; 
      therefore, little is known about the electrophysiological correlates of empathy in 
      aggressive situations that are particularly relevant for psychopathic meanness. 
      METHOD: We employed electroencephalography in a community sample (n = 70), the 
      majority of whom had attained a higher level of education. All participants were 
      screened for not having psychiatric conditions or criminal history. The P3 and late 
      positive potential (LPP) event-related potentials and mu rhythm suppression were 
      examined as indices of empathic processing during the observation of situations in 
      which victims of aggression were depicted. RESULTS: As predicted, it was found that 
      persons with elevated levels of psychopathic meanness scored lower on trait empathy 
      and assigned higher positive valence to the aggression scenes. It is interesting 
      that those scoring higher on meanness also scored higher on empathy for the 
      perpetrator. In addition, it was found that psychopathic meanness was negatively 
      related to LPP amplitudes following pictures of aggressive situations. No 
      significant associations were found between meanness and the P3 or between meanness 
      and mu suppression. CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to assess the 
      electrophysiological signature of empathy during the processing of pictures 
      depicting aggressive situations and the relationships with psychopathic meanness. 
      The outcomes highlight the need for more integrative approaches to further study the 
      complex pattern of relationships between empathy and psychopathic meanness.

TI  - Effects of Conditioned Pain Modulation on the Nociceptive Flexion Reflex in Healthy 
      People: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 794-807
LID - 10.1097/AJP.0000000000000724 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR) is a spinal reflex induced by 
      painful stimuli resulting in a withdrawal response. Research has shown that the NFR 
      is inhibited through endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms, which can be assessed by 
      conditioned pain modulation (CPM) paradigms. Although accumulating research suggests 
      that the NFR can be affected by CPM, no clear overview of the current evidence 
      exists. Therefore, the present review aimed at providing such a synthesis of the 
      literature. In addition, the influence of personal factors on the CPM of the NFR was 
      investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was performed and reported 
      following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses 
      (PRISMA) guidelines. Five electronic databases were searched to identify relevant 
      articles. Retrieved articles were screened on eligibility using predefined inclusion 
      criteria. Risk of bias was investigated according to the modified Newcastle-Ottawa 
      Scale. Levels of evidence and strength of conclusion were assigned following the 
      guidelines of the Dutch Institute for Healthcare Improvement. RESULTS: Forty 
      articles were included. There is some evidence that CPM produced by thermal or 
      mechanical stimuli induces inhibitory effects on the NFR. However, inconclusive 
      evidence exists with regard to the effect of electrical conditioning stimuli. While 
      several personal factors do not affect CPM of the NFR, increased cognitive 
      interference is associated with reduced NFR inhibition. DISCUSSION: The present 
      review demonstrates that certain types of nociceptive conditioning stimuli have the 
      potential to depress, at the spinal level, nociceptive stimuli elicited from distant 
      body regions. Although CPM of the NFR seems to be robust to the influence of several 
      personal factors, it can be affected by cognitive influences.

TI  - Complications associated with chemotherapy in testicular cancer management.
PG  - 213-22
LID - 10.1038/nrurol.2011.26 [doi]
AB  - Testicular cancer is the most common solid tumor among men aged 15-35 years. The 
      introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy has resulted in a cure rate of over 95% 
      for men with testicular cancer, which has put increased emphasis on understanding 
      the morbidity associated with chemotherapy. Hematological, gastrointestinal, 
      gonadal, otological, renal, neurological, and pulmonary toxicities are the most 
      common acute adverse effects. Although most patients recover, some of these effects 
      can persist after the chemotherapy regimen has been completed and can become chronic 
      problems. The late complications associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
      include secondary malignancies, cardiovascular disease, avascular necrosis, and 
      cognitive impairment. Late complications can have considerable effects on survival 
      and quality of life, so close monitoring of patients is critical for the early 
      diagnosis of late adverse effects and to limit associated damage. All patients 
      should adopt a healthy lifestyle and follow age-appropriate cancer screening 
      programs. Hormonal supplementation should be considered for those with a low 
      testosterone level, in order to reduce the risk of sexual dysfunction and metabolic 
      syndrome. Prompt diagnosis of avascular necrosis is essential, and it should be 
      considered in the differential diagnosis for any long-term testicular cancer 
      survivor complaining of hip pain. Finally, sperm cryopreservation should be 
      discussed with all patients before chemotherapy is initiated.

TI  - A novel digital clock drawing test as a screening tool for perioperative 
      neurocognitive disorders: A feasibility study.
LID - 10.1111/aas.13756 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We developed a digital clock drawing test (dCDT), an adaptation of the 
      original pen and paper clock test, that may be advantageous over previous dCDTs in 
      the perioperative environment. We trialed our dCDT on a tablet device in the 
      preoperative period to determine the feasibility of administration in this setting. 
      To assess the clinical utility of this test, we examined the relationship between 
      the performance on the test and compared derived digital clock measures with the 4 
      A's Test (4AT), a delirium and cognition screening tool. METHODS: We recruited a 
      sample of 102 adults aged 65 years and over presenting for elective surgery in a 
      single tertiary hospital. Participants completed the 4AT, followed by both command 
      and copy clock conditions of the dCDT. We recorded time-based clock-drawing metrics, 
      alongside clock replications scored using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) 
      clock scoring criteria. RESULTS: The dCDT had an acceptance rate of 99%. After 
      controlling for demographic variables and prior tablet use, regression analyses 
      showed higher 4AT scores were associated with greater dCDT time (seconds) for both 
      command (β = 8.2, P = .020) and copy clocks (β = 12, P = .005) and lower MoCA-based 
      clock scores in both command (OR = 0.19, P = .001) and copy conditions (OR = 0.14, 
      P = .012). CONCLUSION: The digital clock drawing test is feasible to administer and 
      is highly acceptable to older adults in a preoperative setting. We demonstrated a 
      significant association between both the dCDT time and clock score metrics, with the 
      established 4AT. Our results provide convergent validity of the dCDT in the 
      preoperative setting.

TI  - Screening Mammography Among Older Women: A Review of United States Guidelines and 
      Potential Harms.
PG  - 820-826
LID - 10.1089/jwh.2018.6992 [doi]
AB  - In the United States, older women (aged ≥65 years) continue to receive routine 
      screening mammography surveillance, despite limited evidence supporting the benefits 
      to this subpopulation. This article reviews screening mammography guidelines and the 
      potential harms of such screening for older women in the United States. Published 
      guidelines and recommendations on screening mammography for older women from 
      professional medical societies and organizations in the United States were reviewed 
      from the mid-20th century to present. Observational data were then synthesized to 
      present the documented harms from screening mammography among older women. In 1976, 
      the American Cancer Society recommended to screen all women aged ≥40 years with no 
      upper age limit. With time, other major U.S. medical societies adopted their own 
      screening guidelines without a consensus on age of screening cessation. A 
      population-wide screening effort has largely continued without an upper age limit 
      and with it, a growing body of literature on the harms of screening older women. 
      Reported harms from screening mammography procedures have included physical pain, 
      psychological distress, excessive use of health services from overdiagnoses/false 
      positives, and undue financial expenses. These costs are particularly pronounced 
      among special populations with limited life expectancies such as those of very 
      advanced age ≥80 years, long-term nursing home residents, and the cognitively 
      impaired. When potential harms, remaining life years, and the viability of available 
      treatments are considered, the burdens of screening mammography often outweigh the 
      benefits for older women. For some cases, an individualized approach to 
      recommendations would be appropriate. National guidelines should be updated to 
      provide clear guidance for screening women of advanced age, especially those in 
      special populations with limited life expectancies.

TI  - Face Tuning in Depression.
PG  - 2574-2585
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhaa375 [doi]
LID - bhaa375
AB  - The latest COVID-19 pandemic reveals that unexpected changes elevate depression 
      bringing people apart, but also calling for social sharing. Yet the impact of 
      depression on social cognition and functioning is not well understood. Assessment of 
      social cognition is crucial not only for a better understanding of major depressive 
      disorder (MDD), but also for screening, intervention, and remediation. Here by 
      applying a novel experimental tool, a Face-n-Food task comprising a set of images 
      bordering on the Giuseppe Arcimboldo style, we assessed the face tuning in patients 
      with MDD and person-by-person matched controls. The key benefit of these images is 
      that single components do not trigger face processing. Contrary to common beliefs, 
      the outcome indicates that individuals with depression express intact face 
      responsiveness. Yet, while in depression face sensitivity is tied with perceptual 
      organization, in typical development, it is knotted with social cognition 
      capabilities. Face tuning in depression, therefore, may rely upon altered behavioral 
      strategies and underwriting brain mechanisms. To exclude a possible camouflaging 
      effect of female social skills, we examined gender impact. Neither in depression nor 
      in typical individuals had females excelled in face tuning. The outcome sheds light 
      on the origins of the face sensitivity and alterations in social functioning in 
      depression and mental well-being at large. Aberrant social functioning in depression 
      is likely to be the result of deeply-rooted maladaptive strategies rather than of 
      poor sensitivity to social signals. This has implications for mental well-being 
      under the current pandemic conditions.

TI  - Statin related adverse effects and patient education: a study from resource limited 
      settings.
PG  - 393-401
LID - 10.1080/00015385.2017.1406884 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins are the most widely prescribed class of drugs for coronary 
      artery disease (CAD) patients and yet literature on the prevalence of statin related 
      adverse effects (AEs) and gaps in patient education is quite limited especially in 
      resource-limited settings of developing world. OBJECTIVES: The present study was 
      conducted to determine the prevalence of myopathy (muscle ailments) and other statin 
      associated adverse effects among CAD patients on statin therapy. The study also 
      aimed to assess patient perceptions, attitudes and awareness concerning the use of 
      statins. METHODS: It was a cross-sectional study conducted among 300 adult CAD 
      patients visiting the out-patient department of a tertiary care hospital in North 
      India, who were receiving statins for their diagnosis. An interviewer administered 
      questionnaire was used to collect data on statin use among patients and adverse 
      effects experienced. RESULTS: Myopathy or muscle related ailments like muscle pain, 
      cramps and muscle weakness were the most prevalent (32, 34 and 47%, respectively), 
      followed by numbness, tingling and burning in the extremities (31%). Joint pain and 
      cognitive impairments were seen in nearly 20% of the patients. The level of 
      awareness among participants regarding the use of statins was sub-optimal. Lack of 
      knowledge and under-reporting of adverse effects were major concerns. CONCLUSION: 
      The study shows that a considerable proportion of statin users experience adverse 
      effects and knowledge and awareness amongst patients is inadequate. Awareness 
      programmes and counselling for patients, sensitisation of healthcare professionals 
      and better screening systems for monitoring AEs can help improve the scenario.

TI  - Nonmotor Symptoms in Patients with Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 10.
PG  - 938-944
LID - 10.1007/s12311-017-0869-2 [doi]
AB  - Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) have been described in several neurodegenerative diseases 
      but have not been systematically evaluated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 10 
      (SCA10). The objective of the study is to compare the frequency of NMS in patients 
      with SCA10, Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), and healthy controls. Twenty-eight SCA10, 
      28 MJD, and 28 healthy subjects were prospectively assessed using validated 
      screening tools for chronic pain, autonomic symptoms, fatigue, sleep disturbances, 
      psychiatric disorders, and cognitive function. Chronic pain was present with similar 
      prevalence among SCA10 patients and healthy controls but was more frequent in MJD. 
      Similarly, autonomic symptoms were found in SCA10 in the same proportion of healthy 
      individuals, while the MJD group had higher frequencies. Restless legs syndrome and 
      REM sleep behavior disorder were uncommon in SCA10. The mean scores of excessive 
      daytime sleepiness were worse in the SCA10 group. Scores of fatigue were higher in 
      the SCA10 sample compared to healthy individuals, but better than in the MJD. 
      Psychiatric disorders were generally more prevalent in both spinocerebellar ataxias 
      than among healthy controls. The cognitive performance of healthy controls was 
      better compared with SCA10 patients and MJD, which showed the worst scores. Although 
      NMS were present among SCA10 patients in a higher proportion compared to healthy 
      controls, they were more frequent and severe in MJD. In spite of these comparisons, 
      we were able to identify NMS with significant functional impact in patients with 
      SCA10, indicating the need for their systematic screening aiming at optimal 
      treatment and improvement in quality of life.

TI  - Frailty Syndrome among oldest old Individuals, aged ≥80 years: Prevalence & 
      Correlates.
PG  - 92-101
LID - 10.22540/JFSF-05-092 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Objectives were to study prevalence of frailty among Indian oldest old 
      population, and to detect its correlates. METHODS: A cross sectional community based 
      study was done including 200 healthy participants aged ≥80 years, randomly sampled 
      from Hyderabad city in India. They completed an administered questionnaire and 
      physical function tests including SPPB, grip strength. Cognitive function was 
      assessed using MMSE and depression using GDS. Blood pressure, haemoglobin, and 
      fasting blood sugar were measured for all participants. Frailty was defined using 
      Fried phenotype criteria. Logistic regression was done to identify independently 
      associated correlates. RESULTS: The prevalence of frailty syndrome was 83.4% in our 
      study population. Frailty among men was 80.3% and among women was 84.7%, and it 
      increased with increasing age. The independent correlates which increased the odds 
      of frailty were poor physical performance (SPPB) (OR: 4.21; 95% CI: 1.12-15.83), 
      depression (OR: 3.35; 95% CI: 1.29-8.73), chronic joint pains (OR: 4.90; 95% CI: 
      1.97-12.18) and COPD (OR: 3.01; 95% CI: 1.03- 8.78), while hypertension showed 
      inverse association (OR: 0.33;95% CI: 0.11-0.94). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of 
      frailty among the oldest old is very high. Geriatric medicine protocols must include 
      routine screening for frailty, while also including early detection of poor physical 
      performance, depression, COPD and osteoarthritis.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of pharmacological treatments for acute Lyme neuroborreliosis - 
      a systematic review.
PG  - 1249-59
LID - 10.1111/ene.12744 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Our aim was to evaluate the available evidence for 
      pharmacological treatment of acute Lyme neuroborreliosis as a basis for 
      evidence-based clinical recommendations in a systematic review. METHODS: A 
      systematic literature search of Medline, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and three 
      trial registries was performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
      non-randomized studies (NRS) were evaluated. Risk of bias was assessed using the 
      Cochrane risk of bias tools. The primary outcome was 'residual neurological 
      symptoms' whilst the secondary outcomes were disability, quality of life, pain, 
      fatigue, depression, cognition, sleep, adverse events and cerebrospinal fluid 
      pleocytosis. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. RESULTS: 
      After screening 5779 records, eight RCTs and eight NRS were included. Risk of bias 
      was generally high. No statistically significant difference was found between 
      doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics in a meta-analysis regarding residual 
      neurological symptoms at 4-12 months [risk ratio (RR) 1.27, 95% confidence interval 
      (CI) 0.98-1.63, P = 0.07] or adverse events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.54-1.25, P = 0.35). 
      Significantly fewer neurological symptoms for cefotaxime compared with penicillin 
      were found (RR 1.81, 95% CI 1.10-2.97, P = 0.02). Adverse events were significantly 
      fewer for penicillin (RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.38-0.84, P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence 
      regarding pharmacological treatment of acute Lyme neuroborreliosis is scarce and 
      therefore insufficient to recommend preference of beta-lactam antibiotics over 
      doxycycline or vice versa. However, due to considerable imprecision, relevant 
      differences between treatments cannot be excluded. No evidence suggesting benefits 
      of extended antibiotic treatments could be identified. Further well-designed trials 
      are needed. Individual treatment decisions should address patients' preferences and 
      individual conditions like prior allergic reactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to describe the experience of providing older adult 
      patients with transitional care from an acute care hospital to home in cooperation 
      with a public health center, in order to present the barriers to that care and 
      suggest better organizational methods. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study to 
      show the results of the Geriatric Screening for Care-10 (GSC-10) and outcomes of 
      transitional care. Among 659 hospitalized patients aged 65 years or above who lived 
      in an administrative district, forty-five subjects were enrolled between June 24, 
      2019 and January 23, 2020. Within 48 hours of admission, using the 10 areas of 
      GSC-10, they were assessed for cognitive impairment, depression, polypharmacy (5 or 
      more medications), functional mobility, dysphagia, malnutrition, pain, and 
      incontinence, and were reassessed before discharge. The transitional care plan 
      (containing the treatment summary, the results of the GSC-10 assessment, and the 
      post-discharge plan) was forwarded to a representative of the public health center, 
      who provided continued disease management and various health care services, such as 
      chronic disease and frailty care, and physical rehabilitation. RESULTS: Of all the 
      participants, 64.4% had more than 1 GSC-10 concern. The most prevalent concerns were 
      functional immobility (35.6%) and polypharmacy (22.2%). About 15.6% of the 
      participants were readmitted to a nursing home or hospital. A total of 38 
      participants received the transitional care intervention. They received an average 
      of 2.7 administered interventions. However, the rate of rejection was high (30.1%) 
      and patients were visited an average of 16.5 days after discharge. CONCLUSION: 
      Through our experience of providing transitional care from an acute care hospital to 
      home in cooperation with a public health center, we expect that the transitional 
      care suitable for the Korean medical situation could be established and successful.

      increased dramatically, its potential benefits need to be considered in light of 
      potential negative impacts on physician-patient interactions and the increase in 
      physician cognitive workload. This study aims to understand work system factors 
      contributing to physicians' use of the EHR as a communication tool during 
      primary-care encounters. METHODS: We interviewed 14 primary care physicians on their 
      use of EHRs as a communication tool in patient visits. A qualitative content 
      analysis guided by the work system model identified factors influencing physicians' 
      decisions to share or not share the computer screen with their patients. RESULTS: 
      The analysis revealed 26 factors that influenced physicians' decisions to share the 
      screen, most related to the "task" (reviewing lab records), "tools and technology" 
      (using algorithm calculators for risk prediction), or "individual" (patient 
      interest) elements of the work system. The analysis revealed 15 factors that 
      influenced physicians' decisions not to share the screen, most related to the 
      "individual" (patient's acute pain), "organization" (insufficient time), or "task" 
      (documenting embarrassing information) elements of the work system. CONCLUSION: 
      Eleven physicians made individual decisions to share or not to share the screen in a 
      particular visit based on work-system related factors. Three doctors always shared 
      the screen, based on the idea that it is polite and builds trust. However, several 
      physicians also reported that it was time consuming and caused unnecessary 
      distractions. Understanding these factors is essential to effective EHR redesign and 
      training for improving physician-patient communication.

TI  - Assessing the Construct Validity and Internal Reliability of the Screening Tool Test 
      Your Memory in Patients with Chronic Pain.

AB  - Patients with chronic pain often complain about cognitive difficulties, and since 
      these symptoms represent an additional source of suffering and distress, evaluating 
      the cognitive status of these patients with valid and reliable tests should be an 
      important part of their overall assessment. Although cognitive impairment is a 
      critical characteristic of pain, there is no specific measure designed to detect 
      these effects in this population. The objective was to analyze the psychometric 
      properties of the "Test Your Memory" (TYM) test in patients with chronic pain of 
      three different origins. A cross-sectional study was carried out on 72 subjects free 
      of pain and 254 patients suffering from different types of chronic pain: neuropathic 
      pain (104), musculoskeletal pain (99) and fibromyalgia (51). The construct validity 
      of the TYM was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Hospital 
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADs), Index-9 from MOS-sleep, SF-12, and through the 
      intensity (Visual Analogical Scale) and duration of pain. An exploratory factor 
      analysis was also performed and internal reliability was assessed using Cronbach's 
      alpha. After adjusting for potential confounders the TYM could distinguish between 
      pain and pain-free patients, and it was correlated with the: MMSE (0.89, p<0.001); 
      HAD-anxiety (-0.50, p<0.001) and HAD-depression scales (-0.52, p<0.001); MOS-sleep 
      Index-9 (-0.49, p<0.001); and the physical (0.49, p < .001) and mental components 
      (0.55, p < .001) of SF-12. The exploratory structure of the TYM showed an 8-factor 
      solution that explained 53% of the variance, and Cronbach's alpha was 0.66. The TYM 
      is a valid and reliable screening instrument to assess cognitive function in chronic 
      pain patients that will be of particular value in clinical situations.

TI  - Exploring hyperhidrosis and related thermoregulatory symptoms as a possible clinical 
      identifier for the dysautonomic subtype of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 1736-1742
LID - 10.1007/s00415-019-09325-w [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify associated (non-)motor profiles of Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      patients with hyperhidrosis as a dominant problem. METHODS: This is a 
      cross-sectional, exploratory, analysis of participants enrolled in the Non-motor 
      Longitudinal International Study (NILS; UKCRN No: 10084) at the Parkinson's Centre 
      at King's College Hospital (London, UK). Hyperhidrosis scores (yes/no) on question 
      28 of the Non-Motor Symptom Questionnaire were used to classify patients with normal 
      sweat function (n = 172) and excessive sweating (n = 56) (Analysis 1; n = 228). NMS 
      scale (NMSS) question 30 scores were used to stratify participants based on 
      hyperhidrosis severity (Analysis 2; n = 352) using an arbitrary severity grading: 
      absent score 0 (n = 267), mild 1-4 (n = 49), moderate 5-8 (n = 17), and severe 9-12 
      (n = 19). NMS burden, as well as PD sleep scale (PDSS) scores were then analysed 
      along with other correlates. RESULTS: No differences were observed in baseline 
      demographics between groups in either analysis. Patients with hyperhidrosis 
      exhibited significantly higher total NMSS burden compared to those without 
      (p < 0.001). Secondary analyses revealed higher dyskinesia scores, worse quality of 
      life and PDSS scores, and higher anxiety and depression levels in hyperhidrosis 
      patients (p < 0.001). Tertiary analyses revealed higher NMSS item scores for 
      fatigue, sleep initiation, restless legs, urinary urgency, and unexplained pain 
      (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic hyperhidrosis appears to be associated with a 
      dysautonomia dominant subtype in PD patients, which is also associated with sleep 
      disorders and a higher rate of dyskinesia (fluctuation-related hyperhidrosis). These 
      data should prompt the concept of hyperhidrosis being used as a simple clinical 
      screening tool to identify PD patients with autonomic symptoms.

AB  - Survivors of breast cancer are confronted with a plethora of cancer 
      treatment-related long-term symptoms, the most common being fatigue, hot flashes, 
      sexual dysfunction, arthralgias, neuropathy, and cognitive dysfunction. Survivors of 
      breast cancer also face cancer treatment-related disease states, such as 
      osteoporosis, cardiac dysfunction, obesity, infertility, and secondary cancers. 
      Evidence-based recommendations for screening, prevention, and early intervention 
      should be implemented to improve quality of life and decrease comorbidities in this 
      population.

TI  - Treatment and prevention of postoperative complications in hip fracture patients: 
      infections and delirium.
PG  - 448-54
LID - 10.1007/s10354-013-0228-y [doi]
AB  - The course of older patients with hip fractures is often complicated by infections 
      and delirium. Accurate care and high suspicion for these complications are 
      essential, since these conditions are associated with an increase in mortality, 
      length of hospital stay and nursing home placement, poorer mobility, and functional 
      decline. Because of immunosenescence and higher infection rates, older patients need 
      specific care, immediate diagnosis, and treatment of infections. Numerous guidelines 
      of various medical societies outline the management of nosocomial infections, but 
      there is a need of an individualized treatment plan because of comorbidities and 
      polypharmacy. Hygiene measures have first priority to reduce the rate of infections. 
      Treatment of geriatric syndromes like malnutrition, exsiccosis, gait disorders, 
      falls, delirium, urine incontinence, and organ insufficiency are as important as 
      immunization against pneumococci and influenza. Advanced age, cognitive impairment, 
      hearing loss, peripheral vascular disease, prior delirium episodes, sight disorders, 
      and polypharmacy are established risk factors for delirium; thus, older people with 
      several chronic diseases are prone to delirium. A multifactorial approach, 
      comprising standardized screening, oxygen support, intravenous fluid administration 
      and augmented nutrition, monitoring of vital signs, pain treatment, optimized 
      medication, and modification in perioperative management, significantly reduces 
      delirium incidence during hospitalization for hip fracture. An interdisciplinary 
      approach between surgeons and geriatricians may warrant optimized satisfaction of 
      patients' needs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to examine the effect of a cognitive, 
      behavioral stress management module of Sudarshan Kriya (SK) and P on levels of serum 
      cortisol and pain among the women suffering from advanced stage breast cancer. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Participants (n = 147) were screened and randomized to 
      receive standard care (n = 69) versus standard along with SK and Pranayam (P) 
      intervention (n = 78) imparted in one 18 hrs workshop spread during 3 days. 
      Participants were expected to practice it at home 20 min daily as adjuvant to 
      standard pharmacological treatment for pain. RESULTS: There was a significant 
      difference in blood cortisol levels after 3 months of practice of SK and P. Mean 
      blood levels in the intervention arm were 341.2 ng/ml against 549.2 ng/ml in the 
      control arm (P ≤ 0.002). Pain perception in comparison to control arm reduced by 3 
      points in SK and P arm on 0-10 verbal scale of pain. CONCLUSION: SK and P is an 
      effective intervention in reducing stress and pain among advance stage patients of 
      breast cancer.

      (Brazilian Society of Surgical Oncology)-ESSO fellowship, ESSO members are being 
      offered the opportunity by the BSSO to apply for a visiting observership in Brazil; 
      ESSO fellowship in Breast Surgery- the fellowship provides further specialised 
      training in the multi-modality clinical care specific to the breast cancer patient 
      and a deeper training in breast cancer research; training fellowships- to allow 
      young surgeons to visit a specialist breast unit in Europe, to help them to expand 
      their experience and learn new techniques; congress fellowships- for each ESSO 
      congress the ESSO Scientific Committee awards a number of fellowship grantsto 
      participants from low-income countries to attend the congress; EYSAC (ESSO Young 
      Surgeons and Alumni Club) research fellowship; SSO/ ESSO fellowshipthrough its 
      partnership with ESSO, SSO provides a grant to attend the SSO Annual Symposium; 
      Reciprocal International Exchange Programmes with Japan, Latin America and North 
      America (2). ESSO courses and masterclasses: expanded portfolio of courses, in- and 
      outside Europe, basic and advanced, international faculty, multidisciplinary 
      approach, learning methods: hands-on with human cadavers, workshops in small groups, 
      live and case demonstrations, interactive sessions, 3D videos (for instance in 2017 
      ESSO course on ultrasound of breast in Barcelona, advanced course on oncoplastic 
      surgery in Barcelona, advanced course on breast cancer surgery in Naples) (2). 
      Trials: Interantional Nipple- Sparing Mastectomy Registry (INSPIRE), EURECCA 
      (European Cancer Audit) project. The aim of INSPIRE is to provide pooled evidence 
      derived from a prospective collaborative high-quality registry between international 
      centers, oncological safety, patient- reported outcome measures, launched in March, 
      2016, European Breast Cancer Conference EBCC 10, Amsterdam (2). EXAMINATION: 
      European Board of Surgery Qualification in Breast Surgery (EBSQ in BS): phase 
      1-eligibility assessment (CV, logbook, references); phase 2- test; phase 3- oral 
      examination with 2 clinical cases and 1 critical review of academic paper. The 
      applicant must hold a current license to practice as a surgeon (general or plastic 
      or gynaecologist), demonstrate work for one year in a breast surgery unit with at 
      least 150 new primary breast cancer cases per year, attended at least one national/ 
      international training course in breast surgery and has attended at least one well 
      recognized international congress. The applicant should present a signed log book 
      for breast surgery with application; published either one paper or book chapter on 
      breast disease Conclusions 1. The need for certified breast units: Standardised 
      techniques by specialist breast surgeons across Europe should be the aim. 2. No 
      man's land. Across Europe oncoplastic reconstruction is performed by specialist 
      breast, general or plastic surgeons, sometimes in collaboration with each other. 
      There may be dispute as who should or should not be involved. This needs to be 
      addressed. 3. Oncoplastic reconstruction technique expansion. Significant expansion 
      in number, variety and complexity of available techniques is a fact. A good example 
      would be a 6-fold increase together with a low rate of complications in some Eastern 
      European countries over the last decade 4. CME. European breast surgeons want to 
      improve their skills, as evidenced by fully or overbooked ESSO-endorsed breast 
      surgery courses and other high quality workshops. Applications for the European 
      Examination in Breast Surgery (EBSQBS) continue to increase.

PG  - 272-8

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationships between self-reported cognitive 
      abilities, psychological symptoms and neuropsychological outcomes in PSS. METHODS: 
      Patients with Primary Sjogren's syndrome (PSS) and healthy controls completed a 
      comprehensive neuropsychometric battery and questionnaires: the Centers for 
      Epidemiological Scale-Depression, the Profile of Fatigue-mental domain (Prof-M) for 
      cognitive symptoms, Fatigue Severity Scale, and the Short-Form McGill Pain 
      Questionnaire. RESULTS: Female patients with PSS (N = 39) were similar to controls 
      (N = 17) in estimated premorbid intellectual function, age and education. Depression 
      (P = 0.002), cognitive symptoms (P = 0.001), fatigue (P = 0.000003), and pain (P = 
      0.024) scores were greater in the patient group. Patients with PSS demonstrated 
      inferior performance relative to controls in psychomotor processing (P = 0.027) and 
      verbal reasoning (P = 0.007). Patients with PSS with and without depression had 
      similar performance on multiple tests, but depressed patients had significantly 
      lower scores for executive function (P = 0.041). Cognitive symptoms correlated with 
      verbal memory (P = 0.048), whereas pain correlated with executive function measures 
      (Stroop, P = 0.017) and working memory (Trails B, P = 0.036). In the regression 
      model, depression and verbal memory were independent predictors that accounted for 
      61% of the variance in cognitive symptoms. CONCLUSION: The Prof-M is a simple 
      self-report measure which could be useful in screening PSS subjects who may benefit 
      from detailed psychometric evaluation. Our results are consistent with the 
      hypothesis that depression and verbal memory impairment are overlapping but 
      independent aspects of neural involvement in PSS. While pain and depression are 
      significant confounders of cognitive function in PSS, this study suggests that 
      impaired verbal reasoning ability in PSS is not attributable to pain or depression.

TI  - Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment: HVLA Procedure - Cervical Vertebrae.
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Since the founding of osteopathy by Andrew Taylor Still, M.D., D.O. in 1874, a 
      fundamental principle of osteopathic medicine has been the treatment of somatic 
      dysfunction by using osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT).  Somatic dysfunction 
      is an impaired function of integral components of the somatic system (the body 
      framework). It can include the musculoskeletal, nervous, vascular, and lymphatic 
      systems and combinations of these systems in affected areas of dysfunction.  
      High-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) OMT is one type of technique utilized by various 
      practitioners that can be used to restore health to the somatic system. 
       Specifically, HVLA therapy is a technique used in manual medicine that employs a 
      rapid, therapeutic force of brief duration that travels a short distance within the 
      anatomic range of motion of a joint. The force engages a restrictive barrier to 
      elicit a release of the restriction. HVLA treatment is frequently associated with an 
      audible and palpable "release" in the form of a "pop" accepted to represent 
      cavitation of a spinal intervertebral joint and its subsequent release. The cervical 
      (neck) region is an area between the cranium and the thorax consisting of vascular, 
      musculoskeletal, and neural pathways. It is a common area of injury and somatic 
      dysfunction, resulting in pain and loss of mobility. Understanding the diagnostic 
      approach and the treatment of cervical spinal somatic dysfunction is a cornerstone 
      of manual medicine. Dysfunction may occur at one or many anatomical locations: the 
      atlantooccipital joint, the atlantoaxial joint, the paraspinal musculature, or any 
      of the cervical vertebral joints. Collectively, manual (osteopathic) treatment may 
      include various myofascial release techniques, muscle energy techniques, 
      strain-counter strain techniques, and high-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) techniques. 
      HVLA is used to relieve movement restrictions by applying a quick, therapeutic force 
      of rapid duration that travels a short distance within the range of motion of a 
      joint. HVLA therapy aims to restore a more "normal" range of motion within a joint 
      and alleviate pain. Neck dysfunction is associated with significant health costs and 
      disability, typically due to work-related injuries and improper ergonomic 
      practices.  Symptoms involved in cervical musculoskeletal joint dysfunction include 
      neck pain, stiffness, loss of neck mobility, arm pain, tingling in the upper 
      extremities, weakness, dizziness, and headache. High-velocity low amplitude (HVLA) 
      osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) of the cervical spine is a passive, direct 
      therapy that provides a high-velocity, low amplitude manually applied force to treat 
      motion loss in a somatic dysfunction.  Passive treatment implies that the patient 
      stays inactive throughout this therapy and does not attempt to assist the physician 
      in executing cervical HVLA treatment. This therapy provides direct engagement into 
      the restrictive barrier of the cervical spine. The treatment goal is to forcefully 
      stretch a contracted musculoskeletal system, producing an aggressive response of 
      afferent nerve impulses from the muscle spindles to the central nervous system. The 
      central nervous system will then send a reflex of inhibitory responses to the muscle 
      spindle, relaxing the muscle. HVLA therapy of the cervical spine should be performed 
      only by practitioners who have been educated with this technique and have 
      demonstrated practical and cognitive skills.  Like any other procedure, education, 
      along with pre-procedural screening for contraindications and a detailed review of 
      the risks and benefits, is imperative before HVLA treatment. Informed consent to 
      medical treatment is fundamental in both ethics and law. Patients have the right to 
      receive advice and ask questions about HVLA treatments so that they can make 
      well-founded decisions.

AB  - Objective To describe and analyze cognitive aspects in patients with chronic pain 
      and a control group without pain. Method A case-control study was conducted on 45 
      patients with chronic pain and on 45 control subjects. Data including pain 
      diagnosis, comorbidities and medication used, were evaluated. Cognitive tests, such 
      as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Verbal Fluency Test, Clock Drawing Test 
      and Stroop Test, were applied. Results Patients with chronic pain showed a poorer 
      performance, as shown by the scores of the MoCA test (p < 0.002), Verbal Fluency 
      Test (p < 0.001), Clock Drawing Test (p = 0.022) and Stroop Test (p < 0.000). 
      Chronic pain variable (p = 0.015, linear regression model) was an independent factor 
      for results obtained with the MoCA. Conclusion Patients with chronic pain showed a 
      poorer performance in a brief screening test for cognitive impairment not related to 
      confounding variables, as comorbidities and pain-medication use.

AB  - To assess the predictive value of preoperative cognitive impairment on postoperative 
      in-hospital, short-term, and mid-term outcomes among patients undergoing surgical or 
      transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The review was conducted according to PRISMA 
      guidelines. Articles were identified in EMBASE, Medline, and PubMed. Eligible 
      articles compared the outcomes of patients with and without preoperative cognitive 
      impairment who underwent aortic valve replacement and were published in English 
      between January 1, 1997 and November 1, 2017. The quality of included observational 
      studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The strength of the body of 
      evidence was also assessed. A total of 6163 abstracts were screened by 2 independent 
      reviewers and 31 full-text articles were reviewed. Eight studies met inclusion 
      criteria. The studies included 1 case-control, 5 prospective cohort, and 2 
      retrospective cohort studies. Given the paucity and heterogeneity of studies, 
      meta-analysis was not possible. Five studies were of good quality. Preoperative 
      cognitive impairment is a risk factor for postoperative delirium in 2 studies, 
      increased mid-term mortality in 2 studies, and increased length of stay, risk of 
      discharge to a health-care facility or progressive disability in 1 study. However, 
      given the paucity and methodological flaws of the included studies, the body of 
      evidence on the predictive value of preoperative cognitive impairment on 
      postoperative outcomes remains weak. This systematic review highlights the need for 
      more good quality studies to provide evidence regarding the incidence of cognitive 
      impairment and associations with poor outcomes after aortic valve replacement.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of prodromal clinical features of 
      neurodegeneration in patients with Anderson-Fabry disease (AFD) in comparison to 
      age-matched controls. METHODS: This is a single-center, prospective, cross-sectional 
      study in 167 participants (60 heterozygous females and 50 hemizygous males with 
      genetically confirmed AFD, 57 age-matched controls) using a clinical screening 
      program consisting of structured interview, quantitative tests of motor function, 
      and assessments of cognition, depression, olfaction, orthostatic intolerance, pain, 
      REM sleep behavior disorder, and daytime sleepiness. RESULTS: In comparison to 
      age-matched controls (mean age 48.3 years), patients with AFD (mean age 49.0 years) 
      showed slower gait and transfer speed, poorer fine manual dexterity, and lower hand 
      speed, which was independent of focal symptoms due to cerebrovascular disease. 
      Patients with AFD were more severely affected by depression, pain, and daytime 
      sleepiness and had a lower quality of life. These motor and nonmotor manifestations 
      significantly correlated with clinical disease severity. However, patients with AFD 
      did not reveal extrapyramidal motor features or signs of significant cognitive 
      impairment, hyposmia, orthostatic intolerance, or REM sleep behavior disorder, which 
      commonly precede later neurodegenerative disease. In our cohort, there were no 
      differences in neurologic manifestations of AFD between heterozygous females and 
      hemizygous males. CONCLUSIONS: Aside from cerebrovascular manifestations and small 
      fiber neuropathy, AFD results in a distinct neurologic phenotype comprising poorer 
      motor performance and specific nonmotor features. In contrast to functional loss of 
      glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher disease, α-galactosidase deficiency in AFD is not 
      associated with a typical cluster of clinical features prodromal for 
      neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease.

AB  - Delirium is an acute change in cognitive functioning, characterized by inattention 
      and associated with alterations in awareness and fluctuation in arousal, 
      disorganized thinking, or altered level that preferentially affects older adult 
      patients. In the acutely ill cardiac patient, the incidence of delirium has been 
      reported as high as 73%, depending on the type and sensitivity of delirium 
      assessment. Cardiac patients with delirium experience higher rates of in-hospital 
      and longer-term mortality and are at risk for progressive cognitive impairment, loss 
      of functional independence, and increased hospitalization costs. As such, delirium 
      represents an undesirable outcome in cardiac patients. Care improvements such as 
      identifying risk of delirium at time of admission or in the preoperative setting; 
      training cardiologist, surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses to screen for 
      delirium; implementing delirium prevention programs; and developing standardized 
      delirium treatment protocols might reduce the incidence of delirium and its 
      associated morbidity.

TI  - Quality of life, problems, and needs of disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years 
      after diagnosis.
PG  - 2077-2086

AB  - PURPOSE: After cancer treatment, it is desirable to maintain or regain a high 
      quality of life (QoL) and the ability to accomplish everyday tasks well. Therefore, 
      we substantiated the scarce knowledge regarding long-term QoL after breast cancer, 
      burdensome problems, and unmet needs for more support. METHODS: Disease-free breast 
      cancer survivors (n = 190) who had participated in two randomized controlled 
      exercise trials during primary treatment were followed up to 5 years post-diagnosis. 
      QoL-related functions and symptoms (EORTC QLQ-C30/-BR23), health problems, and 
      support needs were assessed. EORTC-QLQ scores were compared with age-matched 
      normative values from the general population in Germany. RESULTS: QoL-related 
      functions and symptoms in patients during cancer treatment were worse compared to 
      healthy references, but largely improved over time. Yet, cognitive function and 
      sleep were still significantly impaired at 5-year follow-up. Other common long-term 
      problems included sexual issues (45% of survivors), hot flashes (38%), pain (34%), 
      fatigue (24%), and polyneuropathy (21%). Regression analyses indicated fatigue 
      having the strongest impact on global QoL. Support needs were expressed mainly for 
      menopausal disorders (43%), physical performance (39%), sleep problems (38%), 
      arthralgia (37%), cognitive problems (36%), weight problems (32%), and fatigue 
      (31%). CONCLUSIONS: While QoL in disease-free breast cancer survivors 5 years 
      post-diagnosis was largely comparable to the general population on average, still 
      many survivors suffered from adverse effects. There appears to be a need for ongoing 
      screening and support regarding fatigue, sleep problems, cognitive problems, 
      arthralgia/pain, menopausal/sexual symptoms, physical performance, and weight 
      problems during and several years following breast cancer therapy.

TI  - Psychosocial Risk Factors, Interventions, and Comorbidity in Patients with 
      Non-Specific Low Back Pain in Primary Care: Need for Comprehensive and 
      Patient-Centered Care.
PG  - 73
LID - 10.3389/fmed.2015.00073 [doi]
LID - 73
AB  - Non-specific low back pain (LBP) affects many people and has major socio-economic 
      consequences. Traditional therapeutic strategies, mainly focused on biomechanical 
      factors, have had moderate and short-term impact. Certain psychosocial factors have 
      been linked to poor prognosis of LBP and they are increasingly considered as 
      promising targets for management of LBP. Primary health care providers (HCPs) are 
      involved in most of the management of people with LBP and they are skilled in 
      providing comprehensive care, including consideration of psychosocial dimensions. 
      This review aims to discuss three pieces of recent research focusing on psychosocial 
      issues in LBP patients in primary care. In the first systematic review, the 
      patients' or HCPs' overall judgment about the likely evolution of LBP was the factor 
      most strongly linked to poor outcome, with predictive validity similar to that of 
      multidimensional scales. This result may be explained by the implicit aggregation of 
      many prognostic factors underlying this judgment and suggests the relevance of 
      considering the patients from biopsychosocial and longitudinal points of view. The 
      second review showed that most of the interventions targeting psychosocial factors 
      in LBP in primary care have to date focused on the cognitive-behavioral factors, 
      resulting in little impact. It is unlikely that any intervention focusing on a 
      single factor would ever fit the needs of most patients; interventions targeting 
      determinants from several fields (mainly psychosocial, biomechanical, and 
      occupational) may be more relevant. Should multiple stakeholders be involved in such 
      interventions, enhanced interprofessional collaboration would be critical to ensure 
      the delivery of coordinated care. Finally, in the third study, the prevalence of 
      psychosocial comorbidity in chronic LBP patients was not found to be significantly 
      higher than in other patients consulting in primary care. Rather than specifically 
      screening for psychosocial conditions, this suggests taking into account any 
      potential comorbidity in patients with chronic LBP, as in other patients. All these 
      results support the adoption of a more comprehensive and patient-centered approach 
      when dealing with patients with LBP in primary care. As this condition is 
      illustrative of many situations encountered in primary care, the strategies proposed 
      here may benefit most patients consulting in this setting.

TI  - A Performing Arts Intervention Improves Cognitive Dysfunction in 50 Hospitalized 
      Older Adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Arts in medicine programs have emerged as a 
      patient-centered approach that aims to improve health-related quality of life for 
      patients in U.S. hospitals. Storytelling and poetry/monologue recitation are forms 
      of arts-based experiences designed to enhance healing and are delivered by an 
      artist-in-residence. We evaluated the effect of a storytelling/poetry experience on 
      delirium screening scores and patient satisfaction in hospitalized older adults. 
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted an observational pre-post study with a 
      control group in the Acute Care for the Elders (ACE) unit at an academic medical 
      center. A convenience sample of 50 participants was recruited to participate and 
      complete two questionnaires measuring pain, anxiety, general well-being, and 
      distress at hospital admission and at hospital discharge. Multivariable regression 
      models were used to compare delirium screening score (primary outcome) between the 
      control and intervention groups and to adjust for the differences in baseline 
      characteristics between groups. RESULTS: At baseline participants in the 
      intervention group were younger and had significantly lower cognitive impairment 
      compared with those in the control group. Participants exposed to the 
      storytelling/poetry intervention had a lower delirium screening score at hospital 
      discharge compared with those in the control group. The result remained significant 
      after adjusting for age, baseline cognitive impairment, and general well-being. 
      Participants in the intervention group reported a high level of satisfaction with 
      the interaction with the artist delivering the intervention. DISCUSSION AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: An artist in residence-delivered storytelling/poetry experience was 
      associated with a lower delirium score at discharge in this pilot study. Further 
      larger studies in diverse inpatient settings are needed to examine whether 
      storytelling/poetry interventions or other types of arts in medicine programs can 
      prevent or reduce delirium in hospitalized older adults.

TI  - Magnetic resonance imaging in pediatric sickle cell anemia.
PG  - 555-558
AB  - Sickle cell disease is the result of altered genetic make up due to hereditary 
      encounter and its form as homozygous sickle cell anemia is the most common and 
      severe. The disease is characterized by chronic anemia, recurrent pain crises and 
      vascular occlusion. Neurologically, there is a high incidence of stroke in 
      childhood, as well as cognitive dysfunction. Newborn screening programmes and 
      preventative treatments have allowed a much longer lifespan. However, recently, 
      neurological research has shifted to characterizing more subtle aspects of brain 
      development and functioning that may be critically important to the individual's 
      quality of life. The present review article examines the neurological and 
      neurocognitive complications of sickle cell disease, and discusses the importance of 
      magnetic resonance imaging scans in the management of the disease.

TI  - Prevalence of the Use of Opioids for Treatment of Pain in Persons with a Cognitive 
      Impairment Compared with Cognitively Intact Persons: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 512-522
LID - 10.2174/1567205013666160629080735 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe the prevalence of opioid use in persons with a cognitive impairment 
      compared with cognitively intact persons and to explore factors associated with 
      opioid prescription. METHOD: A search was made in PubMed (Medline), Embase, 
      Cochrane, Central, Cinahl, PsychInfo and Web of Science and additional articles were 
      identified by manual search of reference lists. Titles and abstracts were screened 
      and eligible articles reviewed in full-text. A citation check was performed on the 
      included articles for a complete search. Risk of bias of the included studies was 
      assessed using an appropriate tool. RESULTS: The search yielded 610 unique hits and 
      an additional 33 records were identified via reference checking. After screening, 23 
      studies were included. A citation tracking was performed for these 23 articles using 
      Web of Science, which yielded an additional 421 articles for a second screening. 
      After the second screening, 24 studies were included. Opioid use was divided into 
      three classes: weak, strong, and weak and strong combined. In several articles there 
      were more than one study conclusion on different opioid classes or in a different 
      setting. Analysis was performed on the prevalence of opioid use (prescription rates) 
      and the dosage of opioids. The 24 studies yielded a total of 35 study conclusions 
      related to prescription rates and dosage. Of these, four showed a higher use of 
      opioids in persons with a cognitive impairment, 14 an equal distribution, and 17 
      showed lower opioid use in cognitively impaired persons. CONCLUSION: This systematic 
      review provides evidence for general undertreatment of pain with opioids in persons 
      with a cognitive impairment.

TI  - Removing own-limb visual input using mixed reality (MR) produces a "telescoping" 
      illusion in healthy individuals.

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to assess changes in body perception when 
      visual feedback was removed from the hand and arm with the purpose of resembling the 
      visual deprivation arising from amputation. The illusion was created by removing the 
      visual feedback from the participants' own left forearm using a mixed reality (MR) 
      and green screen environment. Thirty healthy persons (15 female) participated in the 
      study. Each subject experienced two MR conditions, one with and one without visual 
      feedback from the left hand, and a baseline condition with normal vision of the limb 
      (no MR). Body perception was assessed using proprioceptive drift, questionnaires on 
      body perception, and thermal sensitivity measures (cold, warm, heat pain and cold 
      pain detection thresholds). The proprioceptive drift showed a significant shift of 
      the tip of the index finger (p<0.001) towards the elbow in the illusion condition 
      (mean drift: -3.71 cm). Self-report showed a significant decrease in ownership 
      (p<0.001), shift in perceptual distortions, (e.g. "It feels as if my lower arm has 
      become shorter") (p=0.025), and changes in sensations of the hand (tingling, 
      tickling) (p=0.025). A significant decrease was also observed in cold detection 
      threshold (p<0.001), i.e. the detection threshold was cooler than for the control 
      conditions. The proprioceptive drift together with the self-reported questionnaire 
      showed that the participants felt a proximal retraction of their limb, resembling 
      the telescoping experienced by phantom limb patients. The study highlights the 
      influence of missing visual feedback and its possible contribution to phantom limb 
      phenomena.

TI  - The Longitudinal Parallel Process Analysis of Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress, 
      Symptom Clusters, and Cognitive Function in Children With Leukemia.
PG  - 244-254
LID - 10.1177/1043454220909785 [doi]
AB  - Background: During treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), children report 
      co-occurring symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, nausea, and depression as 
      a symptom cluster. Central nervous system-directed ALL therapies also put children 
      at risk for cognitive impairments. Cancer therapies can cause an increase in 
      oxidative stress, which may contribute to treatment-related symptoms. This study 
      examined the longitudinal relationships between biomarkers of oxidative stress in 
      the cerebrospinal fluid, the Childhood Cancer Symptom Cluster-Leukemia (CCSC-L), and 
      cognition, in children over the first year of ALL treatment. Methods: Glutathione 
      (GSH) biomarkers of oxidative stress were measured in cerebrospinal fluid collected 
      during treatment lumbar punctures. GSH biomarkers, symptoms, and cognitive function 
      of 132 children aged 3 to 18 years were evaluated at four time points during the 
      first year of leukemia treatment. Participants, 7 years and older, completed 
      self-report measures, and parents reported for younger children. Cognitive function 
      measurements for all participants were completed by parents. A longitudinal 
      parallel-process model was used to explore the influence of the initial measurement 
      and the subsequent change over four time points of the GSH biomarkers on the CCSC-L 
      and cognition. Results: GSH biomarkers increased over the four time points 
      indicating decreasing oxidative stress. When GSH biomarkers were higher (less 
      oxidative stress) at the initial measurement, the CCSC-L severity was lower, 
      cognition was better, and cognition improved over the four measurements. Screening 
      children for high levels of oxidative stress would be a foundation for future 
      intervention studies to address symptom distress and cognitive impairments.

TI  - Case Report: Cognitive Impairment without Clinical Spinal Disease May Be the First 
      Sign of HTLV-1 Neurological Alteration.
PG  - 366-369
LID - 10.4269/ajtmh.19-0218 [doi]
AB  - Human t-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1)-associated myelopathy (HAM) is a 
      progressive neurological disease whose diagnosis is defined by clinical 
      manifestations and seropositivity for HTLV-1 infection. Cognitive impairment (CI) is 
      considered to occur after spinal impairment. A 51-year-old HTLV-1-infected man 
      classified as an asymptomatic carrier presented difficulties in listening 
      comprehension and executive memory. He was assessed for central auditory processing 
      (CAP), cognition (event-related auditory evoked potential [P300]), and 
      otoneurological functions (galvanic vestibular-evoked myogenic potential [gVEMP]). 
      Altered responses were found in CAP, P300, and gVEMP, but the neurological 
      examination and cognitive screening were normal. After a 2-year follow-up, we 
      disclosed a positive Babinski sign, a mild CI, worsened P300, and gVEMP latencies, 
      and the patient reported progressive lumbar pain and difficulty running. He was, 
      then, reclassified as HAM. The first examination, in 2016, had already shown 
      abnormal results in P300 and gVEMP despite the HTLV-1-asymptomatic carrier status. 
      Therefore, tests that provide subclinical measures of neurological disease 
      progression can be useful tools for an early diagnosis and intervention in HTLV-1 
      patients. Electrophysiological results had worsened as well as the clinical status 
      and the cognitive function and the progression from asymptomatic status to an 
      HTLV-1-associated neurological disease occurred within 2 years. Thus, 
      HTLV-1-infected individuals with complaints of CI, hearing, or otoneurological 
      manifestations should be submitted to neuropsychological and electrophysiological 
      tests, allowing them to be properly cared in case of HAM progression.

TI  - Rapid In-Person Cognitive Screening in the Preoperative Setting: Test Considerations 
      and Recommendations from the Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality 
      Improvement (SPAQI).
LID - 100089 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pcorm.2020.100089 [doi]
AB  - There are few cognitive screening tools appropriate for fast-paced settings with 
      limited staffing, and particularly in preoperative evaluation clinics. The Society 
      for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) convened experts in 
      neuropsychology, geriatric medicine, and anesthesiology to conduct a review of the 
      literature and compile a comprehensive list of cognitive screening tools used within 
      primary care and preoperative settings. This Recommendations Statement: 1. 
      summarizes a review of the literature on existing cognitive screening tools used 
      within preoperative settings; 2. discusses factors to consider when selecting 
      cognitive screening tools in a preoperative environment; and 3. includes a work flow 
      diagram to guide use of these screening measures. Methodology involved searching 
      peer-reviewed literature for 29 cognitive screening tools which were identified from 
      the literature that fit inclusion criteria. Of these 29, seven tests have been used 
      in preoperative settings and are discussed. These seven had an average 
      administration time ranging from one to ten minutes. Memory, language, and attention 
      were the most commonly evaluated cognitive domains. Most had adequate sensitivity 
      and specificity to detect cognitive impairment/dementia. While information on the 
      psychometric properties of these tools is limited, the tools discussed are 
      appropriate for lay examiners, are short in duration, and accessible for free or at 
      a low cost. We describe factors that must be considered prior to instrument 
      selection.

TI  - Assessing Nociception by fMRI of the Human Spinal Cord: A Systematic Review.
PG  - 31-9
LID - 10.4137/MRI.S23556 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the use of fMRI of the spinal cord in measuring noxious 
      stimulation. METHODS: The Scopus, Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases were 
      searched, along with the reference lists of included articles. Two independent 
      reviewers screened abstracts, full-text articles, and extracted data. Original 
      research was included if fMRI of the human spinal cord was used to measure responses 
      to noxious stimulation. RESULTS: Of the 192 abstracts screened, 19 met the search 
      criteria and were divided according to their focus: investigating pain responses (n 
      = 6), methodology (n = 6), spinal cord injury (n = 2), or cognition-pain 
      interactions (n = 5). All but one study appear to have observed activity in 
      ipsilateral and dorsal gray matter regions in response to noxious stimuli, although 
      contralateral or ventral activity was also widely observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      nociception can be investigated using spinal fMRI, establishing reliability, 
      standardizing methodology, and reporting of results will greatly advance this field.

TI  - Evaluation and management of the non-motor features of Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 69-85
LID - 10.1177/2040622310387847 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a motor disorder with a 
      characteristic triad of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia. There is now increasing 
      awareness that PD is a complex systemic disorder with many nonmotor symptoms (NMS) 
      which include autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, sensory and neuropsychiatric 
      features. NMS become more common in severity and frequency with advancing disease 
      when neuropsychiatric features such as cognitive impairment and psychosis dominate 
      the clinical picture. NMS are strongly correlated with quality of life for patients 
      and their families as well as institutional care placement. Despite their 
      importance, NMS are poorly recognized by clinicians and often undeclared by 
      patients. Use of a validated screening tool NMSQuest followed by specific symptom 
      assessment instruments strengthens the recognition and holistic management of NMS in 
      PD. Some NMS such as mood disturbance, anxiety, pain and insomnia may be improved by 
      optimization of dopaminergic therapy. Conversely, psychosis, excess daytime 
      somnolence or impulse control disorder (ICD) may be triggered by dopaminergic drugs. 
      Other NMS such as dementia and severe depression may be unresponsive to dopaminergic 
      treatment and may reflect perturbations in cholinergic, serotonergic or 
      noradrenergic neurotransmitter function. These symptoms are more challenging to 
      manage but may be ameliorated to some extent by agents such as acetylcholinesterase 
      inhibitor or antidepressant drugs. This contribution reviews the evidence for the 
      evaluation and management of key NMS in PD (apathy, anxiety, depression, psychosis, 
      dementia, ICD, sleep disturbance, autonomic dysfunction, pain) and highlights the 
      urgent need for both novel therapies and more controlled trials for current 
      therapeutic strategies.

TI  - Health-Related Quality of Life Changes in Prostate Cancer Patients after Radical 
      Prostatectomy: A Longitudinal Cohort Study.
PG  - 556-567
LID - 10.4143/crt.2018.221 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) information related to radical 
      prostatectomy (RP) is valuable for prostate cancer (PC) patients needing to make 
      treatment decisions. We aimed to investigate HRQOL change in PC patients who 
      underwent three types of RP (open, laparoscopic, or robotic) and compared their 
      HRQOL with that of general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were 
      prospectively recruited between October 2014 and December 2015. European 
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire 
      (EORTC QLQ-C30) and PC-specific module (PR25) were administered before surgery 
      (baseline) and at postoperative 3 and 12 months. At each time point, HRQOL was 
      compared, and a difference of 10 out of 0-100 scale was considered clinically 
      significant. RESULTS: Among 258 screened patients, 209 (41 open, 63 laparoscopic, 
      and 105 robotic surgeries) were included. Compared to baseline, physical, emotional, 
      and cognitive functioning improved at 12 months. Role functioning worsened at 3 
      months, but recovered to baseline at 12 months. Pain, insomnia, diarrhea, and 
      financial difficulties also significantly improved at 12 months. Most PR25 scales 
      excluding bowel symptoms deteriorated at 3 months. Urinary symptoms and incontinence 
      aid recovered at 12 months, whereas sexual activity and sexual function remained 
      poor at 12 months. Clinically meaningful differences in HRQOL were not observed 
      according to RP modalities. Compared to the general population, physical and role 
      functioning were significantly lower at 3 months, but recovered by 12 months. Social 
      functioning did not recover. CONCLUSION: Most HRQOL domains showed recovery within 
      12 months after RP, excluding sexual functioning and social functioning. Our 
      findings may guide patients considering surgical treatment for PC.

TI  - Geriatric Syndromes in Hospitalized Older Adults Discharged to Skilled Nursing 
      Facilities.
PG  - 715-22
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14035 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence, recognition, co-occurrence, and recent 
      onset of geriatric syndromes in individuals transferred from the hospital to a 
      skilled nursing facility (SNF). DESIGN: Quality improvement project. SETTING: Acute 
      care academic medical center and 23 regional partner SNFs. PARTICIPANTS: Medicare 
      beneficiaries hospitalized between January 2013 and April 2014 and referred to SNFs 
      (N = 686). MEASUREMENTS: Project staff measured nine geriatric syndromes: weight 
      loss, lack of appetite, incontinence, and pain (standardized interview); depression 
      (Geriatric Depression Scale); delirium (Brief Confusion Assessment Method); 
      cognitive impairment (Brief Interview for Mental Status); and falls and pressure 
      ulcers (hospital medical record using hospital-implemented screening tools). 
      Estimated prevalence, new-onset prevalence, and common coexisting clusters were 
      determined. The extent to which treating physicians commonly recognized syndromes 
      and communicated them to SNFs in hospital discharge documentation was evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Geriatric syndromes were prevalent in more than 90% of hospitalized adults 
      referred to SNFs; 55% met criteria for three or more coexisting syndromes. The 
      most-prevalent syndromes were falls (39%), incontinence (39%), loss of appetite 
      (37%), and weight loss (33%). In individuals who met criteria for three or more 
      syndromes, the most common triad clusters were nutritional syndromes (weight loss, 
      loss of appetite), incontinence, and depression. Treating hospital physicians 
      commonly did not recognize and document geriatric syndromes in discharge summaries, 
      missing 33% to 95% of syndromes present according to research personnel. CONCLUSION: 
      Geriatric syndromes in hospitalized older adults transferred to SNFs are prevalent 
      and commonly coexist, with the most frequent clusters including nutritional 
      syndromes, depression, and incontinence. Despite the high prevalence, this clinical 
      information is rarely communicated to SNFs on discharge.

TI  - Intravenous parecoxib for early postoperative cognitive dysfunction in elderly 
      patients: evidence from a meta-analysis.
PG  - 451-460
LID - 10.1080/17512433.2020.1732815 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammation plays a key role in the etiology and pathology of 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor 
      parecoxib is used for the treatment of acute pain due to its potent 
      anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects. Herein, we evaluated the efficacy and 
      safety of parecoxib on early POCD in geriatric patients. OBJECTIVE: This study was 
      performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of parecoxib for early postoperative 
      cognitive dysfunction (POCD) in elderly patients. METHODS: Comprehensive literature 
      search based on six electronic databases was applied to retrieve all related 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Two independent reviewers screened each article 
      for eligibility according to the predetermined inclusion criteria. The Cochrane's 
      Tool was applied to evaluate the methodological quality of included studies. RevMan 
      5.3 was used to conduct meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eight RCTs comprising a total of 
      1106 subjects prepared for orthopedic surgical operation were selected. All the 
      identified RCTs were conducted in China. The methodological qualities of included 
      studies were judged to be medium to high. The integrated data showed that 
      perioperative intravenous parecoxib could remarkably reduce the incidence of POCD 
      with improved Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Parecoxib could 
      significantly reduce the concentrations of interleukin-6, but results regarding the 
      changes in tumor necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein, and S100β levels 
      remained inconsistent. CONCLUSION: Perioperative parecoxib administration is 
      effective in reducing the incidence of POCD and improving the MMSE score compared 
      with control. However, the beneficial effect of parecoxib has been tested only in 
      the Chinese population. Future RCTs in western countries with larger-scale and more 
      comprehensive neurological tests are needed.

TI  - The time course of attentional biases in pain: a meta-analysis of eye-tracking 
      studies.
PG  - 687-701
LID - 10.1097/j.pain.0000000000002083 [doi]
AB  - Previous meta-analyses investigating attentional biases towards pain have used 
      reaction time measures. Eye-tracking methods have been adopted to more directly and 
      reliably assess biases, but this literature has not been synthesized in relation to 
      pain. This meta-analysis aimed to investigate the nature and time course of 
      attentional biases to pain-related stimuli in participants of all ages with and 
      without chronic pain using eye-tracking studies and determine the role of task 
      parameters and theoretically relevant moderators. After screening, 24 studies were 
      included with a total sample of 1425 participants. Between-group analyses revealed 
      no significant overall group differences for people with and without chronic pain on 
      biases to pain-related stimuli. Results indicated significant attentional biases 
      towards pain-related words or pictures across both groups on probability of first 
      fixation (k = 21, g = 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.71, P = 0.002), how 
      long participants looked at each picture in the first 500 ms (500-ms epoch dwell: k 
      = 5, g = 0.69, 95% CI 0.034-1.35, P = 0.039), and how long participants looked at 
      each picture overall (total dwell time: k = 25, g = 0.44, 95% CI 0.15-0.72, P = 
      0.003). Follow-up analyses revealed significant attentional biases on probability of 
      first fixation, latency to first fixation and dwell time for facial stimuli, and 
      number of fixations for sensory word stimuli. Moderator analyses revealed 
      substantial influence of task parameters and some influence of threat status and 
      study quality. Findings support biases in both vigilance and attentional maintenance 
      for pain-related stimuli but suggest attentional biases towards pain are ubiquitous 
      and not related to pain status.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic headache (headache ≥15 days/month) is a leading cause of 
      disability. Illness perception, beliefs and cognitive models are likely central for 
      patient understanding of their chronic pain condition and are associated with 
      treatment outcome. However, these factors are insufficiently described in chronic 
      headache. OBJECTIVE: To describe illness perception, and to explore the effect of 
      background variables and headache characteristics on illness perceptions in primary 
      and secondary chronic headaches in the general population. METHODS: 30,000 persons 
      aged 3044 from the general population were screened for chronic headache by a mailed 
      questionnaire. Those with self-reported chronic headache were interviewed by 
      headache specialists. The questionnaire response rate was 71%, and the interview 
      participation rate was 74%. The International Classification of Headache Disorders 
      III was applied. Illness perception was assessed by the Revised Illness Perception 
      Questionnaire (IPQ-R). The statistical approach was exploratory. RESULTS: 405 of the 
      516 eligible participants (78%) completed the IPQ-R. Confirmatory factor analysis 
      showed good internal validity in chronic headache. People believed their chronic 
      headache to be long-lasting, with negative life consequences including emotional 
      distress. Severe headache-related disability was associated with more perception of 
      chronicity, more perceived consequences, emotional load and illness identity and 
      less illness coherence. People with secondary chronic headache scored significantly 
      higher on chronicity and life consequences, and had less personal control than those 
      with primary chronic headache. CONCLUSION: Chronic primary and secondary headache is 
      associated with a high symptom burden and chronicity with large perceived negative 
      consequences for daily living, suggesting multidisciplinary management may be 
      necessary.

TI  - Focal Dermal Hypoplasia.
BTI - GeneReviews(®)
AB  - CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Focal dermal hypoplasia is a multisystem disorder 
      characterized primarily by involvement of the skin, skeletal system, eyes, and face. 
      Skin manifestations present at birth include atrophic and hypoplastic areas of skin; 
      cutis aplasia; fat nodules in the dermis manifesting as soft, yellow-pink cutaneous 
      nodules; and pigmentary changes. Verrucoid papillomas of the skin and mucous 
      membranes may appear later. The nails can be ridged, dysplastic, or hypoplastic; 
      hair can be sparse or absent. Limb malformations include oligo-/syndactyly and split 
      hand/foot. Developmental abnormalities of the eye can include 
      anophthalmia/microphthalmia, iris and chorioretinal coloboma, and lacrimal duct 
      abnormalities. Craniofacial findings can include facial asymmetry, notched alae 
      nasi, cleft lip and palate, and pointed chin. Occasional findings include dental 
      anomalies, abdominal wall defects, diaphragmatic hernia, and renal anomalies. 
      Psychomotor development is usually normal; some individuals have cognitive 
      impairment. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Focal dermal hypoplasia can be diagnosed based on 
      clinical findings in individuals with classic ectodermal findings and characteristic 
      limb malformations. Molecular genetic testing may be useful to confirm the diagnosis 
      in these individuals and is used to establish the diagnosis in individuals in whom 
      the clinical findings are inconclusive. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: 
      Care by a dermatologist for painful and pruritic erosive lesions that are prone to 
      infection; referral to an otolaryngologist or gastroenterologist for evaluation and 
      management of large papillomas of the larynx and/or trachea or esophagus causing 
      gastroesophageal disease (GERD); referral to a physical/occupational therapist and 
      hand surgeon for management of hand and foot malformations; standard protocols for 
      management of structural abnormalities of the eyes and kidneys and diaphragmatic 
      hernia and abdominal wall defects. Prevention of secondary complications: 
      Preoperative evaluation by an otolaryngologist for hypopharyngeal and/or tonsillar 
      papillomas. Surveillance: Routine follow up with a dermatologist; routine 
      evaluations for scoliosis, particularly in individuals with costovertebral 
      segmentation abnormalities; routine monitoring of growth and body composition to 
      determine need for nutritional intervention; regular eye examinations; routine 
      screening for cognitive, emotional, behavioral, and adaptive issues. GENETIC 
      COUNSELING: Focal dermal hypoplasia is inherited in an X-linked manner. Females (90% 
      of affected individuals) are heterozygous or mosaic for a PORCN pathogenic variant; 
      live-born affected males (10% of affected individuals) are mosaic for a de novo 
      PORCN pathogenic variant. It is presumed that non-mosaic hemizygous males are not 
      viable. Approximately 95% of females with focal dermal hypoplasia have a de novo 
      pathogenic variant; ~5% inherited the pathogenic variant from a parent. The risk 
      that the PORCN pathogenic variant will be transmitted by an affected heterozygous 
      female is 50%; however, because most male conceptuses with a PORCN pathogenic 
      variant are presumed to be spontaneously aborted, at delivery the expected sex ratio 
      of offspring is: 33% unaffected females; 33% affected females; 33% unaffected males. 
      If the affected female is mosaic for a PORCN pathogenic variant, the risk to her 
      female offspring of inheriting the pathogenic variant depends on the level of 
      mosaicism in her germline and can be as high as 50%. Prenatal testing for 
      pregnancies at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if 
      the pathogenic variant in the family has been identified.

TI  - Relevant factors of depression in dementia modifiable by non-pharmacotherapy: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - 181-191
LID - 10.1111/psyg.12371 [doi]
AB  - Depression in dementia patients is associated with complications such as decreased 
      activities of daily living and decreased quality of life. Because 
      pharmacotherapeutic treatments for depression in dementia patients may have a poor 
      risk-benefit ratio, effective non-pharmacotherapeutic interventions are favourable. 
      However, the development of effective treatments requires the identification of 
      depression-associated factors that can be modified by non-pharmacotherapeutic means 
      in dementia patients. This systematic literature review aimed to identify modifiable 
      factors related to depression and confirm that these factors can be improved by 
      non-pharmacotherapeutic interventions. We searched PubMed, SpringerLink, the Web of 
      Science, and the Cochrane Library for articles published between June 2007 and June 
      2017. We included studies that investigated causes of depression in dementia 
      patients and excluded studies with unclear dementia diagnostic criteria or 
      operational definitions. Of 9004 records screened, 6 studies were included. The 
      participants included community-dwelling individuals and long-term care facility 
      residents. The severity of dementia varied from mild to severe. After reviewing the 
      studies, we identified five modifiable relevant factors in community-dwelling 
      individuals: (i) pain; (ii) neuropsychiatric symptoms; (iii) cognitive decline; (iv) 
      social isolation; and (v) quality of life. In long-term care facility residents, we 
      identified neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life as relevant factors. Our 
      results indicated that non-pharmacological interventions that improve these factors 
      may improve symptoms of depression. A longitudinal study is recommended to clarify 
      the mechanisms underlying depression symptoms and treatment in dementia patients. In 
      addition, further investigation is needed to elucidate the ways in which differing 
      dementia types and severity affect symptoms of depression.

TI  - Portuguese translation, cross-cultural adaptation and reliability of the 
      questionnaire «Start Back Screening Tool» (SBST).
PG  - 38-46
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To translate and perform the cross-cultural adaptation of the StarT Back 
      Screening Tool (SBST) questionnaire to assessment and screening low back pain for 
      Portuguese application, and test their reliability. METHOD: To establish conceptual 
      equivalence in item, semantic and operational concern, there were performed two 
      translations into Portuguese in a independently way. A combined version was obtained 
      by consensus among the authors of the translations in order to be achieved a 
      noticeable version in semantic terms and easy to understand. The synthesis version 
      was administered to 40 subjects distributed by gender, young and older adults, with 
      and without low back pain. Through cognitive interviews with the subjects of the 
      sample, clarity, the acceptability, as well as the familiarization of the Portuguese 
      version was evaluated, promoting the changes necessary for a better understanding. 
      The final Portuguese version of the questionnaire was then back-translated into the 
      original language. To evaluate the SBST-Portugal psychometric properties, 31 
      subjects with low back pain performed two interviews. RESULTS: Participants 
      interviewees reported that in general the items were clear and comprehensible 
      achieving face validity. The reliability of the SBST-Portugal showed a Kappa value 
      of 0,74 (95%IC 0,53-0,95), and the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was 0,93 
      for the total score and 0,93 for the psychosocial subscale. CONCLUSION: The 
      Portuguese version of SBST questionnaire proved to be equivalent to the original 
      English version and reliable for the Portuguese population with low back pain. Being 
      an instrument of easy access and application it could be use in primary care.

TI  - The Digital Tree Drawing Test for Screening of Early Dementia: An Explorative Study 
      Comparing Healthy Controls, Patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment, and Patients 
      with Early Dementia of the Alzheimer Type.
PG  - 1561-1574
LID - 10.3233/JAD-181029 [doi]
AB  - The digital tree drawing test (dTDT) is a newly developed screening tool for the 
      early detection of Alzheimer's disease. It is performed with a digitizing pen, 
      recording each pen stroke with temporal and spatial precision. It was hypothesized 
      that movement characteristics recorded during the painting process contribute to the 
      identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early dementia 
      of the Alzheimer type (eDAT). The study population consisted of 187 participants (67 
      healthy controls, 64 MCI, and 56 eDAT patients) with a mean age of 68.6±10.6 years. 
      Between-group comparisons of the dTDT-variables were conducted with analysis of 
      variance. The diagnostic power of dTDT variables was analyzed with stepwise logistic 
      regressions and areas under curve (AUC) of receiver operating control curves. 
      Cognitively impaired persons used less colors and line widths and changed them less 
      often than healthy subjects (p-values ≤0.05). Compared to control, eDAT patients had 
      larger not-painting periods, were slower, and their pictures had less contrast, 
      image size, and complexity (p-values ≤0.01). Logistic regression models of stepwise 
      selected dTDT variables resulted in an AUC of 0.84 (95% confidence interval (CI) 
      [0.79, 0.90], sensitivity = 0.78, specificity = 0.77) for discriminating healthy 
      subjects from all cognitive impaired, an AUC of 0.77. (95% CI [0.69; 0.85], 
      sensitivity = 0.56, specificity = 0.83) for discriminating healthy controls from MCI 
      patients and an AUC of 0.90 (95% CI [0.84, 0.96], sensitivity = 0.86, 
      specificity = 0.82) for discriminating controls from eDAT patients. The results 
      suggest that digital recording of pen-stroke data during the drawing process can 
      contribute to the screening of cognitive impaired patients.

TI  - Screening of malnutrition and its correlates among a sample of rural elderly in 
      Qalyobeya Governorate, Egypt.
PG  - 156-166
LID - 16394 [pii]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Malnutrition is a multifactorial problem that contributes to many health 
      problems, as a cause or as a consequence. In elderly, it is a major health problem 
      as it leads to progressive decline in physical and cognitive health, increased 
      utilization of health services, and increased mortality. AIM: To screen the elderly 
      persons for malnutrition and to detect the underlying factors of this problem. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 elderly persons. 
      A structured interview questionnaire sheet was used. It included sociodemographic 
      data; anthropometric measurement; the Mini-Nutritional Assessment-Short Form in its 
      Arabic version; and physical, psychosocial, and cognitive risk factors of 
      malnutrition. RESULTS: Overall, 35% of the participants were malnourished and 38.4% 
      were at risk of malnutrition. There were significant associations between 
      malnutrition or being at risk of malnutrition and all the studied sociodemographic 
      characteristics (P<0.05) except tobacco smoking (P=0.39). Moreover, significant 
      association (P<0.05) was detected between malnutrition and lack of physical 
      exercise, oral and gastrointestinal tract problems, chronic pain, physical 
      dependency, number of chronic diseases, and number of drugs taken regularly. Social 
      isolation, insomnia, special senses problems, and depression were the significant 
      psychosocial and cognitive risk factors. CONCLUSION: Malnutrition or being at risk 
      of malnutrition is prevalent among the rural elderly persons in Qalyobeya 
      Governorate. The underlying factors were sociodemographic factors, lack of physical 
      exercise, morbidities, and some psychological and cognitive factors. It is 
      recommended that nutritional assessment should be included in any designed geriatric 
      healthcare and health appraisal for the elderly.

      study.
PG  - 53-64
LID - 10.1007/s11357-020-00294-x [doi]
AB  - The distinction between severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2)-related and community-acquired pneumonias poses significant 
      difficulties, as both frequently involve the elderly. This study aimed to predict 
      the risk of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia based on clinical characteristics at 
      hospital presentation. Case-control study of all patients admitted for pneumonia at 
      Semmelweis University Emergency Department. Cases (n = 30) were patients diagnosed 
      with SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia (based on polymerase chain reaction test) between 
      26 March 2020 and 30 April 2020; controls (n = 82) were historical pneumonia cases 
      between 1 January 2019 and 30 April 2019. Logistic models were built with SARS-CoV-2 
      infection as outcome using clinical characteristics at presentation. Patients with 
      SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia were younger (mean difference, 95% CI: 9.3, 3.2-15.5 
      years) and had a higher lymphocyte count, lower C-reactive protein, presented more 
      frequently with bilateral infiltrate, less frequently with abdominal pain, 
      diarrhoea, and nausea in age- and sex-adjusted models. A logistic model using age, 
      sex, abdominal pain, C-reactive protein, and the presence of bilateral infiltrate as 
      predictors had an excellent discrimination (AUC 0.88, 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) and 
      calibration (p = 0.27-Hosmer-Lemeshow test). The clinical use of our screening 
      prediction model could improve the discrimination of SARS-CoV-2 related from other 
      community-acquired pneumonias and thus help patient triage based on commonly used 
      diagnostic approaches. However, external validation in independent datasets is 
      required before its clinical use.

TI  - The Tactile Dimensions of Abstract Paintings: A Cross-Modal Study.
PG  - 805-22
LID - 10.1177/0301006616643660 [doi]
AB  - In our research, we tested for the existence of cross-modal visual and tactile 
      associations in the experience of abstract art. Specifically, we measured the 
      association of 60 abstract paintings with four couples of antonyms related to 
      texture, such as warm or cold, smooth or rough, lightweight or heavy, soft or hard, 
      investigating if the different modality of presentation on a computer screen (color 
      versions: natural colors, inverted colors, black and white) gave rise to different 
      associations relative to the four couples of opponent qualities. Second, we tested 
      whether there might be differences between the ratings of the paintings when they 
      were presented as images on a computer screen versus in real life at the museum. The 
      results confirmed that associations between visual and tactile experience with such 
      complex stimuli exist. In the case of the couple warm or cold, a significant 
      inversion of associated qualities occurs when the images are presented in inverted 
      colors as opposed to natural colors; furthermore, when presented in black and white, 
      warm evaluations are "cooled down," but cold evaluations remain the same. The degree 
      of smoothness could be considered not associated with the color versions. When seen 
      in black and white, both the mean softness and the mean lightweight-ness of the 
      paintings were reduced; however, in the last case, this effect was more evident for 
      the most lightweight pictures. There is only a slight difference between the two 
      presentations of the paintings as images presented on a computer screen and seen in 
      real life, relative to the warm or cold and soft or hard dimensions. Of the four 
      opponent qualities, the three pairs warm or cold, lightweight or heavy, and soft or 
      hard showed the most interesting results in relation to the cross-modal 
      associations.

      outcomes in prostate cancer survivors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient reports of health related quality of life can provide important 
      information about the long-term impact of prostate cancer. Because patient symptoms 
      and function can differ by age of the survivor, the aim of our study was to examine 
      patient-reported quality of life and prostate symptoms by age at diagnosis among a 
      registry of Dutch prostate cancer survivors. METHODS: A population of 617 
      individuals from the Patient Reported Outcomes Following Initial Treatment and 
      Long-Term Evaluation of Survivorship (PROFILES) database was surveyed using the 
      European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30) and prostate symptom (EORTC QLQ-PR25) scales. Age at 
      diagnosis was the main independent variable, with three age categories: 60 years and 
      younger, 61-70 years, and 71 years and older. Dependent variables were the 
      EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-PR25 scales, divided into positive and negative 
      outcomes. Positive measures of health-related quality of life included global 
      health, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive 
      functioning, and social functioning. Negative outcomes included fatigue, nausea, 
      pain, dyspnea, insomnia, appetite, constipation, and diarrhea. We also assessed 
      sexual activity, and urinary, bowel and hormonal symptoms. Descriptive analyses 
      included frequencies with chi-square tests and medians with Kruskal-Wallis tests. 
      Multivariable adjusted analyses were conducted by median regression modeling. 
      RESULTS: Among the numerous scales showing some unadjusted association with age 
      group, only two scales demonstrated significant differences between prostate cancer 
      patients age 71+ compared to the youngest group (age < 61) after multivariable 
      adjustment. On average, the oldest patients experienced an 8.3-point lower median 
      physical functioning score (β = - 8.3; 95% CI = - 13.9, - 2.8; p = 0.003) and a 
      16.7-point lower median sexual activity score (β = - 16.7; 95% CI = - 24.7, - 8.6; 
      p < 0.001) while controlling for BMI, marital status, time since diagnosis, 
      comorbidities (heart condition), Gleason score, and treatment (prostatectomy). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that patient age at diagnosis should be considered 
      among factors that contribute to health-related quality of life outcomes for 
      prostate cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: A possible 
      reevaluation of screening recommendations may be appropriate to acknowledge age as a 
      factor contributing to health-related quality of life outcomes for prostate cancer 
      survivors.

AB  - PURPOSE: This is an ongoing prospective cohort aiming to examine the biopsychosocial 
      health profiles and predictors of health outcomes of older patients with 
      multimorbidity in primary care in Hong Kong. PARTICIPANTS: From April 2016 to 
      October 2017, 1077 patients aged 60+ years with at least two chronic diseases were 
      recruited in four public primary care clinics in the New Territories East Region of 
      Hong Kong. FINDINGS TO DATE: After weighting, the patients had 4.1 (1.8) chronic 
      conditions and 2.5 (1.9) medications on average; 37% forgot taking medication 
      sometimes; 71% rated their health as fair or poor; 17% were frail; 73% reported one 
      (21%) or two or more (52%) body pain areas; 62% were overweight/obese; 23% reported 
      chewing difficulty, 18% reported incontinence; 36% had current stage 1/2 
      hypertension; 38% had handgrip strength below the cut-off; 10% screened positive in 
      sarcopenia; 17% had mild or severer cognitive impairment; 17% had mild to severe 
      depression; 16% had mild to severe anxiety; 50% had subthreshold to severe insomnia; 
      28% indicated being lonely; 12% needed help in at least one out of the five daily 
      functions and the EuroQoL-5-Dimensions-5-Level index score was 0.81 (0.20) and its 
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score was 67.6 (14.6). In the past 12 months, 17% were 
      hospitalised, 92% attended general outpatient clinics, 70% attended specialist 
      outpatient clinics and 10% used elderly daycare centre services, the median 
      out-of-pocket health cost was HK$1000 (US$150). Female and male patients showed 
      significant differences in many biopsychosocial health aspects. FUTURE PLANS: With 
      assessments and clinical data, the cohort can be used for understanding longitudinal 
      trajectories of biopsychosocial health profiles of Chinese older patients with 
      multimorbidity in primary care. We are also initially planning cohort studies on 
      factors associated with various health outcomes, as well as quality of life and 
      healthcare use. COHORT REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiCTR-OIC-16008477.

TI  - pSynGAP1 disturbance-mediated hippocampal oscillation network impairment might 
      contribute to long-term neurobehavioral abnormities in sepsis survivors.
PG  - 23146-23164
LID - 10.18632/aging.104080 [doi]
AB  - Although more patients survive sepsis and are increasingly discharged from the 
      hospital, they often experience long-term cognitive and psychological impairment 
      with significant socioeconomic impact. However, the pathophysiological mechanisms 
      have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we showed that LPS induced 
      long-term neurobehavioral abnormities, as reflected by significantly decreased 
      freezing time to context and sucrose preference. Using a high-throughput 
      quantitative proteomic screen, we showed that phosphorylation of synaptic 
      GTPase-activating protein 1 (pSynGAP1) was identified as the hub of synaptic 
      plasticity and was significantly decreased following LPS exposure. This decreased 
      pSynGAP was associated with significantly lower theta and gamma oscillations in the 
      CA1 of the hippocampus. Notably, restoration of pSynGAP1 by roscovitine was able to 
      reverse most of these abnormities. Taken together, our study suggested that pSynGAP1 
      disturbance-mediated hippocampal oscillation network impairment might play a 
      critical role in long-term neurobehavioral abnormities of sepsis survivors.

AB  - Pain is often associated with a more rapid progression of cognitive and functional 
      decline, and behavioral disturbance in dementia. Therefore, it is essential to 
      accurately assesses pain for proper intervention in patients with dementia. The 
      Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, and Consolability (FLACC) scale is an excellent behaviour 
      scale which includes most of the domains that are recommended by the American 
      Geriatrics Society to evaluate when assessing pain in patients with dementia. The 
      purpose of this study was to develop the Korean version of the FLACC (K-FLACC) and 
      to verify its reliability and validity in assessing pain of elderly patients with 
      dementia. We developed the K-FLACC to consist of the five domains (face, legs, 
      activity, cry, and consolability) with scores of 0, 1, and 2 for each domain and a 
      total score ranging from 0 to 10 as in the original FLACC. Eighty-eight patients 
      with dementia who visited Konkuk University Medical Center were evaluated. The 
      K-FLACC revealed good validity as compared to the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS; r = 
      0.617, P < 0.001) and the Face Pain Scale (FPS; r = 0.350, P = 0.001). All of the 
      five domains of the K-FLACC were related to the NRS and FPS, in which the activity 
      domain showed the highest correlation. Test-retest reliability was excellent, as the 
      intra-class correlation coefficient comparing the retest to test was 0.73 (95% 
      confidence interval, 0.59-0.82). Our results show that the K-FLACC is a suitable and 
      valuable scale to assess pain in patients with dementia in Korea.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment and self-assessment frequently differ, e. g. in psychosomatic 
      disorders and complaints. At the same time the prevalence of corresponding disorders 
      in old age is high. OBJECTIVE: This study investigated psychosocial factors from the 
      perspective of nursing home residents and compared this self-assessment with data 
      collected in other scientific studies with assessments by nursing home staff. The 
      aim was to develop specific recommendations for the nursing home sector. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional pilot study 256 nursing home residents (average 
      age 81 ± 10.3 years, 69 % female, 31 % male) were questioned about their physical, 
      psychological and social activities and well-being in semistructured anonymous 
      interviews. Psychological screening tests were simultaneously implemented to assess 
      symptoms of depression and dementia using the short form of the geriatric depression 
      scale (GDS-K) and the mini mental status test (MMST). RESULTS: The results showed 
      that 44.6 % of the residents had symptoms of depression and 76.1 % revealed signs of 
      development of dementia. More than half assessed their physical health as good to 
      very good. According to comparable studies nursing staff assessed persistent pain in 
      20.7 % of all nursing home residents while personal interviews with the residents 
      showed that persistent pain (39.8 %) was almost twice as frequent. Life satisfaction 
      showed a significant correlation with the following items from the self-assessment: 
      participation in nursing home activities (r = 0.171, p = 0.008), mobility (r = 
      -0.131; p = 0.045), emotional activity (r = 0.136, p = 0.038), subjectively 
      experienced physical health (r = -0.420, p < 0.001) and persistent pain (r = -0.178, 
      p = 0.006). Life satisfaction correlated highly significantly with symptoms of 
      depression (r = -0.617, p < 0.001) and cognitive performance (r = 0.251, p = 0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: The findings of this study encourage further research on the 
      characteristic features of satisfied residents and (psycho)therapeutic support in 
      order to promote factors for well-being and a positive quality of life in nursing 
      homes.

TI  - A systematic review of the prevalence of comorbid cancer and dementia and its 
      implications for cancer-related care.
PG  - 1254-1271
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2017.1348476 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A comorbid diagnosis of cancer and dementia (cancer-dementia) may have 
      unique implications for patient cancer-related experience. The objectives were to 
      estimate prevalence of cancer-dementia and related experiences of people with 
      dementia, their carers and cancer clinicians including cancer screening, diagnosis, 
      treatment and palliative care. METHOD: Databases were searched (CINAHL, Psychinfo, 
      Medline, Embase, BNI) using key terms such as dementia, cancer and experience. 
      Inclusion criteria were as follows: (a) English language, (b) published any time 
      until early 2016, (c) diagnosis of cancer-dementia and (d) original articles that 
      assessed prevalence and/or cancer-related experiences including screening, cancer 
      treatment and survival. Due to variations in study design and outcomes, study data 
      were synthesised narratively. RESULTS: Forty-seven studies were included in the 
      review with a mix of quantitative (n = 44) and qualitative (n = 3) methodologies. 
      Thirty-four studies reported varied cancer-dementia prevalence rates (range 
      0.2%-45.6%); the others reported reduced likelihood of receiving: cancer screening, 
      cancer staging information, cancer treatment with curative intent and pain 
      management, compared to those with cancer only. The findings indicate poorer 
      cancer-related clinical outcomes including late diagnosis and higher mortality rates 
      in those with cancer-dementia despite greater health service use. CONCLUSIONS: There 
      is a dearth of good-quality evidence investigating the cancer-dementia prevalence 
      and its implications for successful cancer treatment. Findings suggest that dementia 
      is associated with poorer cancer outcomes although the reasons for this are not yet 
      clear. Further research is needed to better understand the impact of cancer-dementia 
      and enable patients, carers and clinicians to make informed cancer-related 
      decisions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To gather consumer perspectives of a mental health screening protocol and 
      to identify the incidence of previously unrecognized mental health concerns (case 
      finding). DESIGN: Pilot study using mixed methods: quantitative (survey) and 
      qualitative (interviews). SETTING: Primary care health team in Kitchener, Ontario, 
      Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Patients (N=15) with spinal cord injury living in the 
      community. Participants ranged in age from 21 to 81 years of age (mean=46); 12 were 
      men, 8 had tetraplegia and 5 paraplegia. The number of years since injury ranged 
      from 1 to 32 (mean=13). INTERVENTION: Implementation of a mental health screening 
      protocol consisting of standardized screening tools for depression, anxiety, 
      substance abuse, social isolation, somatoform disorder, functional status, chronic 
      pain, and cognitive impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Positive results on screening 
      tool, acceptability of the screening process, perceptions of the value of screening, 
      and intentions to follow resulting treatment recommendations. RESULTS: Screening 
      identified 11 of 15 individuals with a chronic pain condition; 1 individual screened 
      positive for depression, 1 for anxiety, 3 for potential substance abuse, and 1 for 
      social isolation. Most of the participants (12/13) rated the screening protocol as 
      very acceptable. All but 1 individual intended to follow resulting treatment 
      recommendations. Interview analyses generated themes related to disclosure of 
      experiences that were incomplete that concealed important information and 
      perceptions that the screening protocol failed to assess resiliency. Although 
      perceived as valuable, participants felt screening tools alone did not capture 
      information important to them. CONCLUSIONS: Screening tools alone may not identify 
      mental health issues. Interviews in addition to screening tools are needed to 
      accurately identify mental health issues in this population. Identification of 
      mental health issues is critical to ensuring access to effective interventions and 
      improving health outcomes and quality of life for individuals with SCI.

AB  - As a typical form of empathy, empathy for pain refers to the perception and 
      appraisal of others' pain, as well as the corresponding affective responses. 
      Numerous studies investigated the factors affecting the empathy for pain, in which 
      the exposure to violent video games (VVGs) could change players' empathic responses 
      to painful situations. However, it remains unclear whether exposure to VVG 
      influences the empathy for pain. In the present study, in terms of the exposure 
      experience to VVG, two groups of participants (18 in VVG group, VG; 17 in non-VVG 
      group, NG) were screened from nearly 200 video game experience questionnaires. And 
      then, the functional magnetic resonance imaging data were recorded when they were 
      viewing painful and non-painful stimuli. The results showed that the perception of 
      others' pain were not significantly different in brain regions between groups, from 
      which we could infer that the desensitization effect of VVGs was overrated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite increased concern about prescription opioid misuse among older 
      adults, there is limited work examining the best means to identify misuse by older 
      adults. The goal of this investigation was to examine the performance the 
      Prescription Drug Use Questionnaire Patient Version (PDUQp), in detecting 
      prescription opioid misuse and prescription opioid use disorders among adult 
      emergency department (ED) patients aged 50 years and older. METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study of a random sample of adult ED patients, aged 50 years and 
      older. All participants were without cognitive impairment and reported prescription 
      opioid use within the past 30 days. We evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, 
      predictive values, and receiver operating characteristics of the PDUQp against a 
      standard definition of opioid misuse and DSM-5 criteria for prescription opioid use 
      disorder. RESULTS: Overall, 112 participants completed the study; 74 were aged 50-64 
      years and 38 were aged 65 years and older. Over half of the participants satisfied 
      DSM-5 criteria for prescription opioid use disorder, with slightly less participants 
      reporting misuse. Overall, the respective sensitivity and specificity of the PDUQp 
      was: 44% and 79% (Receiver Operating Characteristic [ROC] area under the curve: 
      0.61) for prescription opioid misuse, 38% and 81% (ROC area under the curve: 0.64) 
      for the presence of any prescription opioid use disorder, and 56% and 75% (ROC area 
      under the curve: 0.71) for moderate to severe prescription opioid use disorder. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Based on this preliminary work, the PDUQp may be a viable instrument to 
      screen for prescription opioid misuse and prescription opioid use disorder, but it 
      likely requires modifications to optimize its predictive ability in adults over age 
      50 years.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The physical and/or psycho-cognitive changes after stroke may lead to 
      a decline in the quality of life (QOL) of patients. The aims of our study were to 
      evaluate the QOL of stroke survivors and to investigate its relationships with the 
      physical disability degree and the emotional disorders (anxiety and depression). 
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study, which included 147 patients, followed 
      for stroke that had occurred over the past year, in the outpatient neurology 
      department at the university hospital Habib Bourguiba of Sfax (Tunisia). For each 
      patient, we collected socio-demographic characteristics and clinical and therapeutic 
      data. The quality of life of our patients was assessed using the SF-36 scale. The 
      HAD scale was used to screen for anxiety and depression, whereas the modified Rankin 
      scale was used to measure the degree of disability. RESULTS: The average age of our 
      patients was 60.58 years. The overall mean score of the SF-36 ranged from 20.81 to 
      89.81 with an average of 55.27. Impaired QOL was found in 68% of patients. The study 
      of the dimensional average scores revealed that only two dimensions of the SF-36 
      were not altered: physical pain and life and relationship with others. The physical 
      component was slightly more altered than the mental component (41.4 and 42.9 
      respectively). A minimal disability was found in 32% of patients, while a moderate 
      and severe disability was found in 19% and 21.1% of patients. Anxiety was detected 
      in 55.1% of patients and depression in 67.3% of them. Impaired mental component QOL 
      was significantly correlated with the presence of anxiety (P=0.008) and depression 
      (P<<0.05). The severe degree of disability had a significant negative impact on all 
      areas of QOL except that of life and relationships with others. CONCLUSION: It 
      appears from our study that among the important effects of stroke is the constant 
      deterioration of QOL in its various dimensions. The occurrence of emotional 
      disturbances such as anxiety and depression and the degree of physical disability 
      seem to be predictors of QOL impairment. Therefore, special attention should be 
      given to such patients at higher risk of decline in their QOL.

PG  - 75-78
LID - 10.13703/j.0255-2930.2017.01.019 [doi]
AB  - The definition of ashi point has not been unified yet till now. Likewise, the 
      precise explanation on its connotation has always been an elusive question in 
      acupuncture theory. By collecting diverse definitions on ashi point in the textbooks 
      of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, dictionaries and term standards, several rational 
      elements in definitions with consensus were screened. With the assistance of two 
      important theories of cognitive linguistics, such as figure-ground theory and 
      distance iconicity theory, the concept of ashi point was newly defined. 
      Additiona-lly, on the base of the understanding on several similar terms such as 
      "taking the painful site as acupoint", "responding point" and "reactive point", the 
      semanteme analytic method was used to distinguish the difference among them so that 
      the more profound explorations on acupuncture therapy are expounded.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate cognitive impairment and psychological distress of 
      critically ill patients at discharge from intensive care unit (ICU). This study 
      included 30 critically ill patients who had neither pre-existing dementia nor 
      ongoing delirium. At ICU discharge, they performed a screening test for cognitive 
      impairment (Mini-Cog test) and completed questionnaires for depression (Patient 
      Health Questionnaire-2, PHQ-2) and for 4 stressful experiences during ICU stay 
      including nightmares, severe anxiety or panic, severe pain, and trouble to breathe 
      or feeling of suffocation (Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome 14-Question Inventory, 
      PTSS-14 Part A). Thirteen patients (43.3%) screened positive for cognitive 
      impairment and 18 patients (60.0%) exhibited depressive symptoms. Twenty three 
      patients (76.7%) recollected one or more stressful in-ICU experiences. Female 
      patients (88.9%) was more likely to feel depressed at ICU discharge, compared to 
      male patients (47.6%) (χ(2)=4.47, p=0.03). To the best of our knowledge, this is the 
      first report on cognitive and psychological outcomes of ICU survivors in Korea. In 
      this study, we observed that a considerable number of critically ill patients had 
      experienced cognitive impairment or psychological distress at ICU discharge.

TI  - Dance for Adults With Fibromyalgia-What Do We Know About It? Protocol for a Scoping 
      Review.
PG  - e25
LID - 10.2196/resprot.6873 [doi]
LID - e25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder characterized by widespread muscular 
      tenderness, pain, fatigue, and cognitive difficulties. Nonpharmacological treatment 
      options, such as physical activity, are important for people with fibromyalgia. 
      There are strong recommendations to support engagement in physical activity for 
      symptom management among adults with fibromyalgia. Dance is a mode of physical 
      activity that may allow individuals with fibromyalgia to improve their physical 
      function, health, and well-being. Dance has the potential to promote improved pain 
      processing while simultaneously providing the health and social benefits of engaging 
      in physical activity that contributes to symptom management. However, we are unaware 
      of current evidence on dance as a nonpharmacological/physical activity intervention 
      for adults with fibromyalgia. OBJECTIVE: The aims of the study are to provide an 
      overview of the extant evidence to understand how dance is used for individuals with 
      fibromyalgia; to examine the extent, range, and nature of research activity in the 
      area; and to determine the value of undertaking a full systematic review. METHODS: 
      Scoping reviews are useful to comprehensively and systematically map the literature 
      and identify key evidence, or research gaps. The search strategy will involve 
      electronic databases including Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, 
      Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Literature in the 
      Health Sciences in Latin America and the Caribbean (LILACS), Allied and 
      Complementary Medicine (AMED), International Bibliography of Theatre and Dance, 
      Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), Trip, Proquest Theses/Dissertations, Web of 
      Science, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, 
      and ClinicalTrials.gov. The study will be mapped in seven stages: (1) identifying 
      the research questions, (2) identifying relevant studies, (3) selecting the studies, 
      (4) charting the data, (5) collating, summarizing and reporting the results, (6) 
      consulting, and (7) disseminating the knowledge. RESULTS: The search, title, and 
      abstract are now completed; full text screening was carried out and authors are 
      awaiting interlibrary loans and translations. Data extraction will start shortly 
      after full text 'screening' is completed. Completion is expected in Fall 2017. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this will be the first attempt to systematically 
      identify knowledge of dance as a potential intervention for adults with 
      fibromyalgia. This scoping review offers a feasible means for describing the 
      evidence specific to dance and fibromyalgia; results will provide unique insights 
      concerning the breadth and depth of literature in the area. An analysis of this body 
      of literature as a whole may reveal new research directions or unknown ways this 
      intervention could strengthen current management approaches of the disease.

AB  - PURPOSE: Geriatric Assessments (GAs) in older adults with cancer have informed 
      treatment decision-making and refined survival prediction. However, little is known 
      about the needs of older inpatients with cancer. Our objectives were to test the 
      feasibility of a bedside GA, assess the prevalence of impairments in geriatric 
      domains, determine how many were unknown to the medical team, and assess the impact 
      of GA on patient care. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional observational 
      single-centre pilot study. Structured GAs were performed on patients age 65+ 
      admitted to the medical or radiation oncology inpatient wards at a tertiary care 
      cancer centre. GA findings were shared with the patient's most responsible physician 
      (MRP). RESULTS: 356 patients were screened, 39 were eligible and approached, and 37 
      were enrolled (recruitment rate 95%). Completion of the GA was possible in 92% of 
      patients (34/37) and required a mean of 35 min. The mean number of geriatric domains 
      impaired per patient was five (of seven assessed domains). The most common abnormal 
      domains not known to the medical team were medication optimization (91%), cognition 
      (90%), mood (69%), and social vulnerability (69%). MRPs responded to our survey for 
      fifteen of thirty-three participants (45% response rate), and indicated that the GA 
      results provided helpful information for patient management in 10 of 15 cases. 
      CONCLUSION: Abnormal geriatric domains are common in older inpatients with cancer. 
      Domains such as medication optimization, cognition, mood, and social vulnerability 
      often go undetected and unaddressed. Identifying abnormal domains may improve the 
      care of older inpatients with cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low self-efficacy in chronic disease patients is one of the main 
      disturbances which require physical and mental rehabilitation, calling for the 
      development of a home accessible way to improve self-management. OBJECTIVES: The 
      purpose of this study was to explore the effectiveness of a community based 
      Baduanjin exercise on self-efficacy in adults with cardiovascular disease. DESIGN: A 
      randomized controlled trial, longitudinal research design was employed. 
      PARTICIPANTS: After screening by health documents in Community Health Service 
      Station, a total of 134 patients with records of cardiovascular diseases were had 
      been enrolled according to the following inclusion criteria: (1) Community dwelling 
      adults in Xili Community; (2) Patients diagnosed with cardiovascular diseases by 
      community doctors, or other clinicians in health records in the past 3 years 
      (2013-2015); (3) independent walking. Participants were excluded if they: (1) had 
      impaired mobility and limited extremities functionality; (2) had not been in stable 
      health condition and could not adhere to the exercise regime; (3) had communication 
      difficulties and limited ability to follow instructions. METHODS: Participants were 
      randomly assigned to the Baduanjin group or the control group. Those in the 
      Baduanjin group received 16 weeks of Baduanjin exercise training, while those in the 
      control group kept the original exercise mode unchanged. The Self-Efficacy for 
      Managing Chronic Disease 6-item Scale (SEMCD6) was administered to subjects before 
      and after intervention. RESULTS: Demographic data showed that 65.12% of the enrolled 
      129 participants were aged 65 or older, 92.25% received less than 12 years of 
      education, and 68.21% participants' monthly income was less than 1999 RMB. Before 
      intervention, SEMCD6 scores of 86.36% participants in Baduanjin group were below 7 
      points, while 85.71% in control group; after 16 weeks of Baduanjin exercise, SEMCD6 
      scores lower than 7 points in Baduanjin group (21.21%) were significantly lower than 
      that of the control group (84.13%). The increase of SEMCD6 scores in Baduanjin group 
      was statistically significant in the confidence to keep the fatigue, to keep the 
      physical discomfort or pain, to keep the emotional distress and do the different 
      tasks and activities (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with cardiovascular diseases in 
      community have lower level of education, most of whom have a low monthly income; 
      thus, community dwelling cardiovascular disease patients are more suitable for an 
      economic program to persist their long term management of the disease. Baduanjin is 
      a traditional Chinese medicine regimen with less physical and cognitive demand; 
      community based exercise of Baduanjin could help to increase self-efficacy in 
      patients with cardiovascular diseases, thus better self-management of rehabilitation 
      process.

PG  - 80-89
LID - 10.1017/S1478951517000694 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at analyzing the validity and reliability of the 
      continuous reaction time (CRT) test, the finger-tapping test (FTT), the Digit Span 
      Test (DST), the Trail Making Test - part B (TMTB), and the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE) in patients with metastatic cancer. METHOD: Eighty adult patients 
      and 81 healthy controls were assessed between July of 2010 and November of 2015. The 
      neuropsychological tests were analyzed regarding construct/discriminant/criterion 
      validity and reliability. RESULTS: In terms of construct validity, it was not 
      possible to estimate a model for the MMSE because of a skewed response distribution. 
      For discriminant validity, patients were slower on two measures of the CRT (p = 
      0.00483, p = 0.00030) and FTT dominant hand (p = 0.00306). Regarding sensitivity and 
      specificity, only the DST and TMTB seemed to predict cognitive deficit; however, the 
      ROC curve areas were ≤ 0.73. In terms of criterion validity, there were few 
      significant correlations between the tests and the sociodemographic and clinical 
      variables, and for the most part were very weak. Reliability was deemed to be 
      adequate for the TMTB, DST, and FTT. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: The findings of the 
      full validation analyses were not clear-cut. However, CRT test, DST, FTT, and TMTB 
      demonstrated partial positive results, indicating that these tests have good 
      potential for use in clinical settings and require further study.

TI  - Development of a Semaphore of Anemia: Screening Method Based on Photographic Images 
      of the Ungueal Bed Using a Digital Camera.
PG  - 1931-1935
LID - 10.1109/EMBC44109.2020.9176017 [doi]
AB  - Anemia is a disease present worldwide. High prevalence of anemia (43%) is found in 
      the child population and its main long-term effect (slow cognitive development) can 
      remain even if the disease has disappeared. One of the main reasons for the high 
      prevalence of anemia in Peru is the poor screening coverage during the growth of the 
      child due to the parents' fear of infringing pain on their children. We take 
      advantage that anemia produces pallor in the hands, fingers and ungueal bed to 
      develop a semaphore for this disease. This screening tool uses photographic images 
      of the patient's ungueal bed to determine if they have a high, medium or low 
      possibility of having anemia. Sixty people participated in the study and 6 
      photographic images for each participant's right hand were captured. The images were 
      processed to extract regions of interest from each of the fingernails. Datasets were 
      generated and a neural network was used to predict the risk of anemia. Initial 
      results show that the proposed semaphore of anemia reaches a sensitivity of 0.79 and 
      specificity of 0.91. These results indicate that the semaphore of anemia may be used 
      as a screening method to reduce the number of blood tests and the time of evaluation 
      from 15 minutes (rapid test with portable hemoglobinometer) to 1 minute.

      Questionnaire for suspected Lyme disease.
PG  - 249-273
LID - 10.2147/IJGM.S140224 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Lyme disease is spreading worldwide, with multiple Borrelia species causing 
      a broad range of clinical symptoms that mimic other illnesses. A validated Lyme 
      disease screening questionnaire would be clinically useful for both providers and 
      patients. Three studies evaluated such a screening tool, namely the Horowitz 
      Multiple Systemic Infectious Disease Syndrome (MSIDS) Questionnaire. The purpose was 
      to see if the questionnaire could accurately distinguish between Lyme patients and 
      healthy individuals. METHODS: Study 1 examined the construct validity of the scale 
      examining its factor structure and reliability of the questionnaire among 537 
      individuals being treated for Lyme disease. Study 2 involved an online sample of 999 
      participants, who self-identified as either healthy (N=217) or suffering from Lyme 
      now (N=782) who completed the Horowitz MSIDS Questionnaire (HMQ) along with an 
      outdoor activity survey. We examined convergent validity among components of the 
      scale and evaluated discriminant validity with the Big Five personality 
      characteristics. The third study compared a sample of 236 patients with confirmed 
      Lyme disease with an online sample of 568 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Factor 
      analysis results identified six underlying latent dimensions; four of these 
      overlapped with critical symptoms identified by Horowitz - neuropathy, cognitive 
      dysfunction, musculoskeletal pain, and fatigue. The HMQ showed acceptable levels of 
      internal reliability using Cronbach's coefficient alpha and exhibited evidence of 
      convergent and divergent validity. Components of the HMQ correlated more highly with 
      each other than with unrelated traits. DISCUSSION: The results consistently 
      demonstrated that the HMQ accurately differentiated those with Lyme disease from 
      healthy individuals. Three migratory pain survey items (persistent muscular pain, 
      arthritic pain, and nerve pain/paresthesias) robustly identified individuals with 
      verified Lyme disease. The results support the use of the HMQ as a valid, efficient, 
      and low-cost screening tool for medical practitioners to decide if additional 
      testing is warranted to distinguish between Lyme disease and other illnesses.

AB  - Aging is associated with normal and abnormal brain and cognitive changes. Due to the 
      expected increase in older adults requiring surgery, perioperative clinicians will 
      be increasingly encountering patients with neurodegenerative disease. To help 
      perioperative clinicians understand signs of abnormal behaviors that may mark an 
      undiagnosed neurodegenerative disorder and alert additional patient monitoring, The 
      Society for Perioperative Assessment and Quality Improvement (SPAQI) worked with 
      experts in dementia, neuropsychology, geriatric medicine, neurology, and 
      anesthesiology to provide a summary of cognitive and behavioral considerations for 
      patients with common neurodegenerative disorders being evaluated at preoperative 
      centers. Patients with neurodegenerative disorders are at high risk for delirium due 
      to known neurochemical disruptions, medication interactions, associated frailty, or 
      vascular risk profiles presenting risk for repeat strokes. We provide basic 
      information on the expected cognitive changes with aging, most common 
      neurodegenerative disorders, a list of behavioral features and considerations to 
      help differentiate neurodegenerative disorders. Finally, we propose screening 
      recommendations intended for a multidisciplinary team in the perioperative setting.

TI  - Symptom expression in advanced cancer patients admitted to hospice or home care with 
      and without delirium.
PG  - 515-520
LID - 10.1007/s11739-018-1969-9 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between delirium and 
      symptom expression in advanced cancer patients admitted to palliative care services. 
      This is a secondary analysis of a consecutive sample of advanced cancer patients who 
      were admitted to home care and hospices, and prospectively assessed for a period of 
      10 months. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the MDAS (Memorial 
      Delirium Assessment Scale) were measured at admission (T0) and after seven days of 
      home care or hospice care (T7). Of the eight hundred and forty-eight patients 
      screened in the period, 585 were not considered in the analysis for various reasons. 
      The mean age was 72.1 years (SD 13.7), and 146 patients were males (55.5%). The mean 
      Karnofsky status recorded at T0 is 34.1 (SD = 6.69). The mean duration palliative 
      care assistance is 38.4 days (SD = 48, range 2-220). Of 263 patients who had a MDAS 
      available at T0, 110 patients (41.8%) had a diagnosis of delirium. Of them, 167 
      patients had complete data regarding MDAS measurement, either at T0 and T7. A larger 
      number of patients (n 167, 63.5%) had delirium after a week of palliative care. 
      Patients with delirium are likely to be older, to have a lower Karnofsky level at 
      T0, and to be home care patients. At T0, weakness, nausea, drowsiness, lack of 
      appetite, and well-being are associated with delirium. At T7, weakness, poor 
      appetite, and poor well-being are significantly associated with delirium. 27% of 
      patients who had a normal cognitive status at T0 developed delirium at T7. In 
      patients with delirium, an improvement in the cognitive status corresponds to a 
      significant improvement in weakness, depression, and appetite. Conversely, the 
      occurrence of delirium in patients who had a normal cognitive status at admission 
      significantly increases the level depression, while the level of weakness and 
      appetite decrease. Symptom expression is amplified in patients with delirium 
      admitted to home care or hospices, while patients without delirium can be more 
      responsive to palliative treatments with a significant decrease in intensity of ESAS 
      items.

TI  - Mental illness in metropolitan, urban and rural Georgia populations.
PG  - 414
LID - 10.1186/1471-2458-13-414 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mental illness represents an important public health problem. 
      Local-level data concerning mental illness in different populations (e.g., 
      socio-demographics and residence--metropolitan/urban/rural) provides the 
      evidence-base for public health authorities to plan, implement and evaluate control 
      programs. This paper describes prevalence and covariates of psychiatric conditions 
      in Georgia populations in three defined geographic areas. METHODS: Data came from 
      the Georgia population-based random-digit-dialing study investigating unwellness and 
      chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in Georgia populations of three defined geographic 
      areas (metropolitan, urban, and rural). Respondents were screened for symptoms of 
      fatigue, sleep, cognition, and pain at household screening interviews, and a 
      randomly selected sample completed detailed individual phone interviews. Based on 
      the detailed phone interviews, we conducted one-day clinical evaluations of 292 
      detailed interview participants classified as unwell with a probable CFS (i.e. 
      CFS-like; a functional somatic syndrome), 268 classified as other unwell, and 223 
      well (matched to CFS-like). Clinical evaluation included psychiatric classification 
      by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM (SCID). To derive prevalence 
      estimates we used sample weighting to account for the complexity of the multistage 
      sampling design. We used 2- and 3-way table analyses to examine socio-demographic 
      and urbanicity specific associations and multiple logistic regression to calculate 
      adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Anxiety and mood disorders were the most common 
      psychiatric conditions. Nineteen percent of participants suffered a current anxiety 
      disorder, 18% a mood disorder and 10% had two or more conditions. There was a 
      significant linear trend in occurrence of anxiety or mood disorders from well to 
      CFS-like. The most common anxiety disorders were post-traumatic stress disorder 
      (PTSD) (6.6%) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) (5.8%). Logistic regression 
      showed that lower education and female sex contributed significantly to risk for 
      both PTSD and GAD. In addition, rural/urban residence and Hispanic ethnicity were 
      associated with PTSD. We defined moderate to severe depression as Major Depressive 
      Disorder or a Zung score>60 and logistic regression found lower education to be 
      significantly associated but sex, age and urbanicity were not. CONCLUSIONS: Overall 
      occurrence of anxiety and mood disorders in Georgia mirrored national findings. 
      However, PTSD and GAD occurred at twice the published national rates (3.6 and 2.7%, 
      respectively). State and local prevalence and associations with education, sex and 
      urbanicity comprise important considerations for developing control programs. The 
      increased prevalence of anxiety and mood disorders in people with a functional 
      somatic syndrome (or CFS-like illness) is important for primary care providers, who 
      should consider additional psychiatric screening or referral of individuals 
      presenting with somatoform symptoms.

      high-throughput screening.
PG  - 1307-22
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S101486 [doi]
AB  - Lyme disease is the most common zoonotic bacterial disease in North America. It is 
      estimated that >300,000 cases per annum are reported in USA alone. A total of 
      10%-20% of patients who have been treated with antibiotic therapy report the 
      recrudescence of symptoms, such as muscle and joint pain, psychosocial and cognitive 
      difficulties, and generalized fatigue. This condition is referred to as 
      posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome. While there is no evidence for the presence of 
      viable infectious organisms in individuals with posttreatment Lyme disease syndrome, 
      some researchers found surviving Borrelia burgdorferi population in rodents and 
      primates even after antibiotic treatment. Although such observations need more 
      ratification, there is unmet need for developing the therapeutic agents that focus 
      on removing the persisting bacterial form of B. burgdorferi in rodent and nonhuman 
      primates. For this purpose, high-throughput screening was done using BacTiter-Glo 
      assay for four compound libraries to identify candidates that stop the growth of B. 
      burgdorferi in vitro. The four chemical libraries containing 4,366 compounds (80% 
      Food and Drug Administration [FDA] approved) that were screened are Library of 
      Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC1280), the National Institutes of Health 
      Clinical Collection, the Microsource Spectrum, and the Biomol FDA. We subsequently 
      identified 150 unique compounds, which inhibited >90% of B. burgdorferi growth at a 
      concentration of <25 µM. These 150 unique compounds comprise many safe antibiotics, 
      chemical compounds, and also small molecules from plant sources. Of the 150 unique 
      compounds, 101 compounds are FDA approved. We selected the top 20 FDA-approved 
      molecules based on safety and potency and studied their minimum inhibitory 
      concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration. The promising safe 
      FDA-approved candidates that show low minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum 
      bactericidal concentration values can be chosen as lead molecules for further 
      advanced studies.

AB  - In accordance with a novel strategy for generating the 2-benzazepine scaffold by 
      connecting C6-C1 and C3-N building blocks, a set of 5-phenylsulfanyl- and 
      5-benzyl-substituted tetrahydro-2-benzazepines was synthesized and pharmacologically 
      evaluated. Key steps of the synthesis were the Heck reaction, the Stetter reaction, 
      a reductive cyclization, and the introduction of diverse N substituents at the end 
      of the synthesis. High σ1 affinity was achieved for 2-benzazepines with linear or 
      branched alk(en)yl residues containing at least an n-butyl substructure. The butyl- 
      and 4-fluorobenzyl-substituted derivatives, 
      (±)-5-benzyl-2-butyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-2-benzazepine (19 b) and 
      (±)-5-benzyl-2-(4-fluorobenzyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-2-benzazepine (19 m), show 
      high selectivity over more than 50 other relevant targets, including the σ2 subtype 
      and various binding sites of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. In the Irwin 
      screen, 19 b and 19 m showed clean profiles without inducing considerable side 
      effects. Compounds 19 b and 19 m did not reveal significant analgesic and 
      cognition-enhancing activity. Compound 19 m did not have any antidepressant-like 
      effects in mice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a marked growth in the number of homebound older adults, due 
      mainly to increased life expectancy. Although this group has special characteristics 
      and needs, it has not been properly studied. This study thus aimed to measure the 
      prevalence of homebound status in a community-dwelling population, and its 
      association with both socio-demographic, medical and functional characteristics and 
      the use of health care and social services. METHODS: We used instruments coming 
      under the WHO International Classification of Functioning (ICF) framework to carry 
      out a cross-sectional study on populations aged 50 years and over in the province of 
      Zaragoza (Spain), covering a total of 1622 participants. Persons who reported severe 
      or extreme difficulty in getting out of the house in the last 30 days were deemed to 
      be homebound. We studied associations between homebound status and several relevant 
      variables in a group of 790 subjects who tested positive to the WHODAS-12 disability 
      screening tool. RESULTS: Prevalence of homebound status was 9.8 % (95 % CI: 8.4 to 
      11.3 %). Homebound participants tended to be older, female and display a lower 
      educational level, a higher number of diseases, poorer cognition and a higher degree 
      of disability. In fully adjusted models including disability as measured with the 
      ICF-Checklist, the associated variables (odds ratios and [95 % confidence 
      intervals]) were: female gender (3.75 [2.10-6.68]); urban population (2.36 
      [1.30-4.29]); WHODAS-12 disability (6.27 [2.56-15.40]); depressive symptoms (2.95 
      [1.86-4.68]); moderate pain (2.37 [1.30-4.31] and severe pain (3.03 [1.31-7.01]), as 
      compared to the group with no/mild pain; hospital admissions in the previous 3 
      months (2.98 [1.25-7.11]); and diabetes (1.87 [1.03-3.41]). Adjustment for 
      ICF-Checklist disability had a notable impact on most associations. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      study shows that homebound status is a common problem in our setting, and that being 
      disabled is its main determinant. Socio-demographic characteristics, barriers and 
      chronic diseases can also be assumed to be playing a role in the onset of this 
      condition, indicating the need for further research, including longitudinal studies 
      on its incidence and associated factors.

TI  - Impaired GAD1 expression in schizophrenia-related WISKET rat model with 
      sex-dependent aggressive behavior and motivational deficit.
PG  - e12507
LID - 10.1111/gbb.12507 [doi]
AB  - After peri-adolescence isolation rearing (IS) and subchronic ketamine (KET) 
      treatment, adult, selectively bred Wistar rats (named WISKET) mimic abnormal 
      behaviors reminiscent of human schizophrenia, including reduced prepulse-inhibition 
      of startle reflex, disturbances in cognition, locomotor activity and 
      thermoregulation, decreased pain sensitivity and electrophysiological alterations. 
      To further validate our WISKET rat line, regarding its translational utility in 
      schizophrenia research, we examined their social behavior and introduced a short and 
      simple holeboard (HB)-like test to investigate their motivational deficit that 
      predicts the cognitive disturbance. Sex-dependent alterations in schizophrenia may 
      yield important insights into its etiology; thus, male and female WISKET rats were 
      also investigated and compared with their naive Wistar counterparts. Considering the 
      contribution of the hippocampal and cortical GABAergic inhibitory circuitry in these 
      behavioral alterations, molecular-biology studies were also performed regarding the 
      GAD1 gene products. Impaired social activity with increased aggression, 
      stress-related behavior, active social withdrawal, motivation deficit and decreased 
      exploration were observed, especially in male WISKET rats, compared with Wistar ones 
      and their corresponding females. These alterations were accompanied by sex-dependent 
      alterations regarding GAD67 mRNA and protein expression in the prefrontal cortex and 
      hippocampus. In conclusion, the WISKET animals are valuable tools for animal-based 
      preclinical drug discovery studies for predictive screening of novel compounds 
      improving negative symptoms with potential antipsychotic efficacy.

TI  - A computer-based screening method for distress in patients with multiple sclerosis: 
      a feasibility study.
PG  - e29
LID - 10.2196/resprot.3098 [doi]
LID - e29
AB  - BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, symptoms of anxiety, depression, 
      pain, and cognitive impairment are highly prevalent and contribute to lower 
      wellbeing. As these physical and psychological symptoms of distress often stay 
      unnoticed, regular screening could offer possibilities to identify and refer 
      impaired patients to appropriate care. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to pilot 
      a new computer-based method in 43 MS patients to efficiently screen for a variety of 
      psychological and physical symptoms of distress. METHODS: Data on feasibility and 
      psychological and physical distress (anxiety, depression, fatigue, physical 
      disability, cognitive functioning) were collected via a touch screen computer. 
      Referral to psychosocial care and rehabilitation was retrospectively checked. 
      RESULTS: The results demonstrated that most patients (35/40, 88%) considered the 
      screening meaningful and the system easily usable (37/40, 93%). Average completion 
      time of the screening was below 8 minutes. Many patients (35/40, 88%) had elevated 
      distress levels, of whom the majority was referred. CONCLUSIONS: These findings 
      imply that computer-based screening for MS-related distress incorporated in clinical 
      care is feasible and aids to identify psychological or physical needs. A randomized 
      controlled trial with follow-up should address whether this screening method could 
      be more effective than routine care, and whether it can improve costs and efficiency 
      of care.

TI  - Effects of milnacipran on neurocognition, pain, and fatigue in fibromyalgia: a 
      13-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial.
LID - 10.4088/PCC.13m01555 [doi]
LID - PCC.13m01555
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether milnacipran is safe and effective in improving 
      cognitive function in patients with fibromyalgia. METHOD: Patients were randomly 
      assigned to receive milnacipran or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by a 1-week washout 
      and then crossover to the other arm for another 6 weeks. The overall trial lasted 13 
      weeks and was conducted between July 2011 and May 2013. Assessments were performed 
      at each visit. Neurocognition was measured by the Brief Assessment of Cognition 
      (BAC) and MATRICS. Pain was assessed by the visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. 
      Global assessment of fibromyalgia symptoms was measured by the Fibromyalgia Impact 
      Questionnaire (FIQ) and tender point examination. Depression was assessed by the 
      Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Fatigue was assessed by the Fatigue Severity Scale. 
      Functional outcome was evaluated by the Health Assessment Questionnaire. The 
      Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) 
      scales and the Patients Clinical Global Impression of Change were used to measure 
      the global impression of severity and improvement. RESULTS: 26 subjects were 
      screened, and 20 subjects completed the trial. The change in verbal memory (P = 
      .001) and the composite T score (P = .044) of the BAC and the change in the 
      attention-vigilance domain T score (P = .042) were significantly improved, but there 
      were no differences between the drug and placebo groups. The changes in the CGI-S 
      scores were not significant, but the changes in the Clinical Impression-Improvement 
      (CGI-I) scores showed worsening in the placebo group at week 1 (P = .032), week 2 (P 
      = .024), week 4 (P = .024), and week 6 (P = .60) compared to baseline. The change in 
      FIQ scores was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Milnacipran may have a potential role 
      in the improvement of pain, disability, and mood. The effect of milnacipran on 
      cognition in fibromyalgia needs further research. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01829243.

TI  - Development and validation of the Brief Assessment of Distress about Pain.
LID - 10.1002/ejp.1751 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The experience of pain is a complex interaction of somatic, behavioural, 
      affective and cognitive components. Negative psychological states (e.g., anxiety, 
      fear and depression) are intertwined with pain and contribute to poorer outcomes for 
      individuals suffering from chronic and acute pain by exacerbating the overall 
      experience of pain and leading to increased dysfunction, disability, and distress. A 
      need exists for efficient assessment of aversive emotional states that are 
      associated with pain. METHODS: A multistage developmental process included expert 
      judges, two undergraduate samples, and a chronic pain patient sample. The 4-item 
      Brief Assessment of Distress about Pain (BADP) scale was developed to assess 
      anxiety, fear, and depression related to pain, as well as an overall evaluation of 
      distress about pain. RESULTS: Principal components analyses indicated that the BADP 
      consisted of one factor. Inter-scale correlation coefficients revealed that the BADP 
      was highly related to other measures that assess similar constructs, suggesting 
      evidence for convergent validity. Intra-scale correlation coefficients indicated 
      that the items of the BADP were only moderately associated with each other. Findings 
      also supported evidence for discriminative validity, test-retest reliability, and 
      internal consistency of the BADP. CONCLUSIONS: The BADP has good psychometric 
      properties as a measure of negative affectivity related to pain. The scale's single 
      negative affectivity item may be useful for screening. The BADP helps address a gap 
      in the literature with regard to a brief measure assessing fear, anxiety, 
      depression, and negative affect in relation to pain. Demonstrated utility in a 
      patient sample indicates the measure is suitable for further clinical study. 
      SIGNIFICANCE: The BADP provides an efficient, psychometrically-supported means to 
      assess affective distress (i.e., anxiety, fear, depression, and negative affect) 
      associated with pain.

AB  - HIV has become a highly treatable disease due to advances in antiretroviral therapy 
      (ART). Additionally, HIV-infected individuals often take opiates, barbiturates, and 
      benzodiazepines to treat co-occurring conditions, including pain and symptoms of 
      HIV. We sought to examine prescription medication misuse by surveying 295 
      HIV-infected patients receiving ART. Participants answered questions about their 
      demographics, alcohol and other drug use, psychiatric diagnoses, ART adherence and 
      side effects, and quality of life. Eleven percent of our sample acknowledged 
      prescription medication misuse. In regression analysis, prescription medication 
      misusers were more likely to report any drinking to intoxication (OR=4.31, 95% CI: 
      1.35-13.76, p=0.013), reported greater severity of ART side effects (OR=1.05, 95% 
      CI: 1.01-1.10, p=0.041), and demonstrated poorer cognitive functioning (OR=0.97, 95% 
      CI: 0.94-0.99, p=0.048) compared to those who did not misuse prescription 
      medications. Special care should be taken by medical providers before prescribing 
      medications that may be abused or diverted. Patients should also be screened for 
      aberrant use, even if not prescribed. ART side effects, cognitive deficits, and 
      alcohol abuse may serve as risk factors or indicators of prescription medication 
      misuse, and should be monitored.

TI  - Foot Problems in Older Adults (Associations with Incident Falls, Frailty Syndrome, 
      and Sensor-Derived Gait, Balance, and Physical Activity Measures).
PG  - 126-139
LID - 10.7547/15-186 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Research on foot problems and frailty is sparse and could advance using 
      wearable sensor-based measures of gait, balance, and physical activity (PA). This 
      study examined the effect of foot problems on the likelihood of falls, frailty 
      syndrome, motor performance, and PA in community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: 
      Arizona Frailty Cohort Study participants (community-dwelling adults aged ≥65 years 
      without baseline cognitive deficit, severe movement disorders, or recent stroke) 
      underwent Fried frailty and foot assessment. Gait, balance (bipedal eyes open and 
      eyes closed), and spontaneous PA over 48 hours were measured using validated 
      wearable sensor technologies. RESULTS: Of 117 participants, 41 (35%) were nonfrail, 
      56 (48%) prefrail, and 20 (17%) frail. Prevalence of foot problems (pain, peripheral 
      neuropathy, or deformity) increased significantly as frailty category worsened (any 
      problem: 63% in nonfrail, 80% in prefrail [odds ratio (OR) = 2.0], and 95% in frail 
      [OR = 8.3]; P = .03 for trend) due to associations between foot problems and both 
      weakness and exhaustion. Foot problems were associated with fear of falling but not 
      with fall history or incident falls over 6 months. Foot pain and peripheral 
      neuropathy were associated with lower gait speed and stride length; increased double 
      support time; increased mediolateral sway of center of mass during walking, age 
      adjusted; decreased eyes open sway of center of mass and ankle during quiet 
      standing, age adjusted; and lower percentage walking, percentage standing, and total 
      steps per day. CONCLUSIONS: Foot problems were associated with frailty level and 
      decreased motor performance and PA. Wearable technology is a practical way to screen 
      for deterioration in gait, balance, and PA that may be associated with foot 
      problems. Routine assessment and management of foot problems could promote earlier 
      intervention to retain motor performance and manage fear of falling in older adults, 
      which may ultimately improve healthy aging and reduce risk of frailty.

TI  - The relationship between mirror-touch synaesthesia and empathy: New evidence and a 
      new screening tool.
PG  - 314-332
LID - 10.1080/02643294.2018.1457017 [doi]
AB  - People with mirror-touch synaesthesia (MTS) report tactile sensations on their own 
      body when seeing another person being touched. Although this has been associated 
      with heightened empathy and emotion perception, this finding has been disputed. 
      Here, we conduct two experiments to explore this relationship further. In Experiment 
      1, we develop a new screening measure for MTS. We show that MTS is related to 
      vicarious experiences more generally, but is not a simple exaggerated version of 
      normality. For example, people with MTS report videos of scratching as "touch" 
      rather than "itchiness" and have localized sensations when watching others in pain. 
      In Experiment 2, we show that MTS is related to increased emotional empathy to 
      others and better ability to read facial expressions of emotion, but other measures 
      of empathy are normal. In terms of theoretical models, we propose that this is more 
      consistent with a qualitative difference in the ability to selectively inhibit the 
      other and attend to the self.

TI  - Diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome: creation of an electronic version of 
      a patient-reported outcome instrument by conversion from a pen-and-paper version and 
      evaluation of their equivalence.
PG  - 83-95
LID - 10.2147/PROM.S126605 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjects with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D) 
      experience abdominal cramping, bloating, pressure, and pain. Due to an absence of 
      clinical biomarkers for IBS-D severity, evaluation of clinical therapy benefits 
      depends on valid and reliable symptom assessments. A patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
      instrument has been developed, comprising of two questionnaires - the IBS-D Daily 
      Symptom Diary and IBS-D Symptom Event Log - suitable for clinical trials and 
      real-world settings. This program aimed to support instrument conversion from 
      pen-and-paper to electronic format. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Digital technology 
      (Android/iOS) and a traditional mode of administration study in the target 
      population were used to migrate or convert the validated PRO IBS-D pen-and-paper 
      measure to an electronic format. Equivalence interviews, conducted in three waves, 
      each had three parts: 1) conceptual equivalence testing between formats, 2) 
      electronic-version report-history cognitive debriefing, and 3) electronic version 
      usability evaluation. After each inter-view wave, preliminary analyses were 
      conducted and modifications made to the electronic version, before the next wave. 
      Final revisions were based on a full analysis of equivalence interviews. The final 
      analysis evaluated subjects' ability to read, understand, and provide meaningful 
      responses to the instruments across both formats. Responses were classified 
      according to conceptual equivalence between formats and mobile-format usability 
      assessed with a questionnaire and open-ended probes. RESULTS: Equivalence interviews 
      (n=25) demonstrated conceptual equivalence between formats. Mobile-application 
      cognitive debriefing showed some subjects experienced difficulty with font/screen 
      visibility and understanding or reading some report-history charts and summary 
      screens. To address difficulties, minor revisions/modifications were made and 
      landscape orientation and zoom-in/zoom-out features incorporated. CONCLUSION: This 
      study indicates that the two administration modes are conceptually equivalent. Since 
      both formats are conceptually equivalent, both are psychometrically reliable, as 
      established in the pen-and-paper version. Subjects found both mobile applications 
      (Android/iOS) offered many advantages over the paper version, such as real-time 
      assessment of their experience.

TI  - Use of standard risk screening and assessment forms to prevent harm to older people 
      in Australian hospitals: a mixed methods study.
PG  - 704-713
LID - 10.1136/bmjqs-2016-005867 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standard risk screening and assessment forms are frequently used in 
      strategies to prevent harm to older people in hospitals. Little is known about good 
      practices for their use. OBJECTIVE: Scope the preventable harms addressed by 
      standard forms used to screen and assess older people and how standard forms are 
      operationalised in hospitals across Victoria, Australia. METHODS: Mixed methods 
      study: (1) cross-sectional audit of the standard risk screening and assessment forms 
      used to assess older people at 11 health services in 2015; (2) nine focus groups 
      with a purposive sample of 69 participants at 9 health services. Descriptive 
      analysis examined the number of items on forms, preventable harms assessed and 
      sources of duplication. Qualitative thematic analysis of focus group data identified 
      themes explaining issues commonly affecting how health services used the forms. 
      RESULTS: 152 standard assessment forms from 11 Victorian health services included 
      over 3700 items with 17% duplicated across multiple forms. Assessments of skin 
      integrity and mobility loss (including falls) were consistently included in forms; 
      however, nutrition, cognitive state, pain and medication risks were inconsistent; 
      and continence, venous thromboembolism risk and hospital acquired infection from 
      invasive devices were infrequent. Qualitative analyses revealed five themes 
      explaining issues associated with current use of assessment forms: (1) comprehensive 
      assessment of preventable harms; (2) burden on staff and the older person, (3) 
      interprofessional collaboration, (4) flexibility to individualise care and (5) 
      information management. Examples of good practice were identified. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Current use of standard risk screening and assessment forms is associated with a 
      high burden and gaps in assessment of several common preventable harms that can 
      increase risk to older people in hospital. Improvement should focus on streamlining 
      forms, increased guidance on interventions to prevent harm and facilitating 
      front-line staff to manage complex decisions.

TI  - Hypnotherapy for Procedural Pain and Distress in Children: A scoping Review 
      Protocol.
LID - pnab038 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/pm/pnab038 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Inadequately treated pain and distress elicited by medical procedures can 
      put children at higher risks of acute and chronic biopsychosocial sequelae. Children 
      can benefit from hypnotherapy, a psychological tailored intervention, as an adjunct 
      to pharmacological agents to address the multiple components of pain and distress. 
      Despite providing evidence on the effectiveness and potential superiority of 
      hypnotherapy to other psychological interventions, research on hypnotherapy for 
      paediatric procedural pain and distress has been predominantly limited to oncology 
      and needle procedures. Plus, there is a lack of reporting of intervention manuals, 
      factors influencing hypnotic responding, pain unpleasantness outcomes, theoretical 
      frameworks, adverse events, as well as barriers and facilitators to the feasibility 
      of delivering the intervention and study procedures. The proposed review aims to map 
      the range and nature of the evidence on hypnotherapy for procedural pain and 
      distress in children to identify gaps in literature and areas requiring further 
      investigation. METHODS: This review will follow the Arksey and O'Malley (2005) 
      methodology and incorporate additional scoping review recommendations by The Joanna 
      Briggs Institute and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and 
      Meta-Analyses. Relevant studies will be identified through searching published 
      literature databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus and 
      Web of Science) and grey literature in addition to hand-searching of reference lists 
      and key journals. Two authors will independently screen titles and abstracts of 
      search results followed by full-texts review against eligibility criteria. 
      CONCLUSION: Findings are anticipated to guide future research and inform the 
      development of tailored hypnotic interventions in children.

AB  - A growing amount of evidence indicates that 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) 
      increases the risk of early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). Here, we describe a 
      36-year-old patient with EOPD. The patient presented with 22q11.2DS features, 
      including associated cognitive disabilities, hypocalcaemia and facial dysmorphia 
      that led us to screen for and confirm this deletion. In addition, hypocalcaemia and 
      vitamin D deficiency were the main factors responsible for severe, painful muscle 
      spasms that were non-levodopa (L-Dopa) responsive and remitted after calcium and 
      vitamin D replacement therapy. Many patients with this deletion remain undiagnosed 
      until adulthood due to the absence of 'major' phenotypic hallmarks, which usually 
      present during early childhood. Later onset problems involving various medical 
      subspecialties are increasingly recognised as important components of 22q11.2DS. 
      Therefore, the multisystem nature and associated burden of morbidities demand a high 
      degree of suspicion for this entity from all clinicians regardless of their medical 
      subspecialty.

TI  - Adherence to recommended practices for perioperative anesthesia care for older 
      adults among US anesthesiologists: results from the ASA Committee on Geriatric 
      Anesthesia-Perioperative Brain Health Initiative ASA member survey.
PG  - 6

AB  - BACKGROUND: While specific practices for perioperative care of older adults have 
      been recommended, little is known regarding adherence by US physician 
      anesthesiologists to such practices. To address this gap in knowledge, the ASA 
      Committee on Geriatric Anesthesia and the ASA Perioperative Brain Health Initiative 
      undertook a survey of ASA members to characterize current practices related to 
      perioperative care of older adults. METHODS: We administered a web-based 
      questionnaire with items assessing the proportion of practice focused on delivery of 
      care to older adults, adherence to recommended practices for older surgical 
      patients, resource needs to improve care, and practice characteristics. RESULTS: 
      Responses were collected between May 24, 2018, and June 29, 2018. A total of 25,587 
      ASA members were invited to participate, and 1737 answered at least one item (6.8%). 
      96.4% of respondents reported that they had cared for a patient aged 65 or older 
      within the last year. 47.1% of respondents (95% confidence interval, 44.6%, 49.7%) 
      reported using multimodal analgesia among patients aged 65 and older at least 90% of 
      the time, and 25.5% (95% CI, 23.3%, 27.7%) provided preoperative information 
      regarding postoperative cognitive changes at least 90% of the time. Over 80% of 
      respondents reported that preoperative screening for frailty or dementia, 
      postoperative screening for delirium, and preoperative geriatric consultation 
      occurred in fewer than 10% of cases. Development of practice guidelines for 
      geriatric anesthesia care and expansion of web-based resources were most frequently 
      prioritized by respondents as initiatives to improve care in this domain. 
      DISCUSSION: Most survey respondents reported providing anesthesia care to older 
      adults, but adherence to recommended practices varied across the six items assessed. 
      Reported rates of screening for common geriatric syndromes, such as frailty, 
      delirium, and dementia, were low among survey respondents. Respondents identified 
      multiple opportunities for ASA initiatives to support efforts to improve care for 
      older surgical patients.

TI  - Structural Models for the Design of PKMzeta Inhibitors with Neurobiological 
      Indications.
PG  - 665-78
LID - 10.1002/minf.201500003 [doi]
AB  - An atypical protein kinase C, PKMzeta has become an attractive target for various 
      neurological disorders including long term potentiation, cognition, neuropathic pain 
      and cancer. Drug discovery efforts have been hindered due to the non-availability of 
      the protein structure and hence in the present study we attempted to build the open 
      and closed models of the protein PKMzeta using homology modeling. The models were 
      then used to identify PKMzeta inhibitors utilizing a high-throughput virtual 
      screening protocol from a large commercial chemical database. Compounds were 
      selected based on the binding interactions and Glide score. Compounds were then 
      subjected to in vitro luminescent based kinase assay for their inhibitory activity 
      on targeted protein. Seven compounds exhibited IC50 s less than or equal to 10 µM. 
      Cell based assays revealed that Lead C3 and Lead C6 exhibited selectivity towards 
      methylmercury treated neuroblastoma growth inhibition and suppressed reactive oxygen 
      species with IC50 s of 0.89 and 0.17 µM, respectively. Furthermore, Lead C3 
      exhibited attenuation of proinflammatory response with least energy in dynamic 
      simulation studies and thus emerged as a prototypical lead for further development 
      as novel inhibitor of PKMzeta for neurological implications.

TI  - Quality of life in Malaysian colorectal cancer patients.
PG  - 110-7
LID - 10.1111/appy.12055 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The rapidly increasing of incidence colorectal cancer (CRC) in 
      Malaysia and the introduction of new treatments that prolong survival advocating 
      treatment outcome measures such as patients' quality of life (QOL) are evaluated in 
      this study. The study aims to determine QOL in CRC patients according to cancer 
      stage and age. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from June to December 
      2011 at four public tertiary hospitals. The European Organization for Research and 
      Treatment in Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire Core-30 (EORTC QLQ C-30) 
      questionnaire was used through face-to-face interview and the medical records of 160 
      respondents were reviewed. RESULTS: The mean age of respondents was 58.47 ± 12.04 
      years with 57.5% of respondents being male and 42.5% female. The majority of 
      respondents were in CRC stages III and IV. Median global health status (GHS) score 
      was 83.33 (IQR 16.67). Sikhs and Indians had a higher median GHS score compared to 
      other ethnicities (Kruskal-Wallis, χ(2)  = 12.12, p = 0.007). Emotional, cognitive 
      and social functions were higher in respondents with earlier stage of disease 
      (Kruskal-Wallis, χ2 = 6.06, 6.36, 10.58, p = 0.048, 0.042, 0.005). Median pain, 
      dyspnea, diarrhea and financial implication scores were significantly higher in 
      advanced stage of disease (Kruskal-Wallis, χ(2)  = 9.31, 6.26,6.77, 7.28, p = 0.010, 
      0.044,0.034,0.026). Median diarrhea score (p = 0.012) was significantly different 
      between age groups. DISCUSSION: Emotional, cognitive and social functions 
      deteriorate with advanced stage of disease. Patients with advanced stage disease 
      experience more pain, dyspnea, diarrhea and financial implications. A systematic 
      screening program to detect cases as early as possible is essential nationwide.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain assessment is challenging in older people with cognitive impairment 
      who present to the emergency department and may result in suboptimal management. 
      Therefore, the usefulness of the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) tool 
      for older people with cognitive impairment presenting with a painful injury was 
      evaluated. METHODS: In this multi-centre observational sub-study, older people (≥65 
      years) suspected of a long bone fracture were screened for cognitive impairment 
      using the Six Item Screening (SIS) tool. Patients with SIS≤4 were assessed using the 
      PAINAD. Descriptive and correlation statistical analyses were performed. Cronbach's 
      alpha was used to estimate the reliability of the PAINAD. RESULTS: This 
      predominantly female (63%) sample had a mean age of 85.5±7.5 years and a moderately 
      urgent Australian Triage code (mode: 3). Median pain intensity was low (numerical 
      reporting scale: 5.5 [3.0-8.0]). Median PAINAD score was 'mild' (1.0 [0.0-3.2]) with 
      wide variability (range: 0-9). The PAINAD demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's 
      α=0.80). Most PAINAD items appeared worthy of retention. CONCLUSIONS: The PAINAD has 
      potential as an effective pain assessment tool for older people with cognitive 
      impairment in emergency departments. Strategies such as partnering with carers and 
      family to collaboratively assess pain require further investigation in this setting.

AB  - Diagnosing pediatric intensive care unit-acquired weakness (PICU-AW) is challenging. 
      The Medical Research Council (MRC) score is a widely used screening method for 
      muscle weakness in critically ill adults; however, its utility in critically ill 
      children has not been established. Our objective was to determine the feasibility 
      and interobserver reliability of muscle strength testing using MRC score in 
      critically ill children. A prospective observational substudy of critically ill 
      children aged 1 to 17 years and limited to bed rest during the first 48 hours of 
      PICU admission was evaluated with weekly MRC exams independently performed by two 
      clinical raters. MRC exams were attempted on all 33 participants, but could be 
      completed in only 21 (64%), 9 of who (43%) received at least one exam while in the 
      PICU, and in the remaining 12 (57%), MRC exams could only be completed after PICU 
      discharge. Of the 95 attempted MRC exams, 55 (57%) could not be conducted or 
      completed, most commonly due to patient sedation, and inability to comply due to 
      cognitive ability, pain, or noncooperation. The inter-rater reliability for MRC sum 
      score was excellent (intraclass correlation coefficient: 0.87). However, the 
      inter-rater reliability was only moderate when used to determine PICU-AW (Cohen 
      kappa: 0.48). MRC testing in the PICU was not feasible as an early screening tool 
      for muscle weakness in the majority of critically ill children in this study. 
      Further research is needed to find an appropriate screening tool that is both 
      feasible and predicts clinically relevant outcomes in children, such as function and 
      recovery following critical illness.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To evaluate the body of evidence on the predictive value of 
      preoperative cognitive impairment on in-hospital, short-term, and midterm 
      postoperative outcomes for elderly patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty 
      (TKA). SIGNIFICANCE: With an aging population, an increasing percentage of the U.S. 
      patient population will be living with cognitive impairment. There is currently no 
      systematic review that assesses postoperative outcomes of patients with mild 
      cognitive impairment (MCI) or preexisting diagnosis of dementia while undergoing 
      elective primary TKA. RESULTS: A database search between January 1, 1997, and 
      November 1, 2017 in EMBASE, MEDLINE, and PubMed was conducted to identify articles 
      that compared postoperative outcomes after TKA between patients aged 60 years with 
      and without cognitive impairment. Cognitive impairment included preexisting 
      diagnosis of dementia or MCI identified during preoperative assessment. Eligible 
      articles were selected using dual reviewer and third-party arbitrator. The quality 
      of the studies was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The strength of 
      evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development 
      and Evaluation approach. A total of 6163 abstracts were screened. Only 11 full text 
      articles met inclusion criteria, including 1 case-control, 5 prospective cohort, and 
      5 retrospective cohort studies. Two studies were of poor quality. Overall, there is 
      moderate strength of evidence for increased risk of postoperative delirium, 
      increased length of stay, and discharge to health-care facility among patients with 
      preoperative MCI or preexisting dementia. The body of evidence is weak for other 
      outcomes of interest including mortality, functionality and complications while 
      in-hospital and in the short- and midterm. CONCLUSION: This review highlights the 
      need for additional good quality studies to provide more information about MCI and 
      dementia as risk factors in primary TKA.

AB  - In public health, the plight of the solitary elderly is associated with serious 
      social and medical burden. In this vulnerable population, neuropsychiatric 
      complications such as senile depression and dementia as well as chronic pain 
      conditions often co-occur. In this case report, we present a case of an 81-year-old 
      solitary woman who received one year of visiting care service with Korean medicine 
      treatments in a public health setting. During the one year, her pain severity 
      (measured using numeric rating scale) remained moderate after her initial decline 
      and her depressive symptoms and cognitive function scales (Geriatric Depression 
      Scale-Short Form Korean and the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      for Dementia Screening) remained almost unchanged; however, another cognitive 
      function scale (Korean version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment) showed 
      noticeable improvements. This case report suggests that providing visiting care 
      services with Korean medicine may be a viable strategy for addressing the issues of 
      the solitary elderly.

LID - 10.1089/apc.2014.0006 [doi]
AB  - Chronic pain in HIV-infected patients is prevalent but understudied. A limitation of 
      HIV/chronic pain research to date is the lack of a widely used chronic pain 
      screening tool. A Brief Chronic Pain Screening tool (BCPS) has been described, but 
      has not yet been tested in a clinical population. This study sought to evaluate how 
      the BCPS is experienced by HIV-infected individuals, and adapt its questions if 
      necessary. We conducted cognitive interviews using cognitive inquiry in participants 
      from the UAB 1917 HIV Clinic Cohort. Data were analyzed using a process of 
      inductive, iterative coding by three investigators. RESULTS: Of 30 participants, 
      most were male, African American, and less than 50 years old. Participants reported 
      that the questions were understandable; however, feedback suggested concerns 
      regarding lack of specificity in regard to the intensity and consistency of pain. An 
      introductory statement aimed at improving clarity resulted in more divergent 
      responses. This research team concluded that the version of the BCPS used in the 
      first 30 interviews was optimum. Its inclusive language allows the respondent to 
      decide what pain merits reporting. This study is the first investigation of the BCPS 
      in a clinical population, and should lead to further quantitative validation studies 
      of this tool.

AB  - CONTEXT: The challenges of palliative care clinical trial recruitment are well 
      documented. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to review tested strategies to 
      improve recruitment to trials of people with a range of conditions who may access 
      palliative care services but are not explicitly stated to be "palliative." METHODS: 
      This was a systematic review with narrative description. The Cochrane, Embase, 
      PubMed, PsycINFO, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched (English; January 
      2002 to February 2014) for quasi-experimental and randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) testing the effect of recruitment strategies on accrual to clinical trials of 
      people with organ failure and cancer. Titles, abstracts, and retrieved articles were 
      screened by two researchers and categorized by recruitment challenge: 1) patients 
      with reduced cognition, 2) those requiring emergency treatment, and 3) willingness 
      of patients and clinical staff to contribute to trials. RESULTS: Of 549 articles 
      identified, 15 were included. Thirteen reported RCTs and two papers reported three 
      quasi-experimental studies. Five were cluster RCTs of recruiting sites/institutions. 
      One was a randomized cluster, crossover, feasibility study. Seven studies recruited 
      patients with cancer. Others included patients with dementia, stroke, cardiovascular 
      disease, diabetes, frail elderly, and bereaved carers. Some interventions improved 
      recruitment: memory aid, contact before arrival, cluster consent, "opt out" consent. 
      Others either reduced recruitment (formal mental capacity assessment) or made no 
      difference (advance research directive; a variety of educational, supportive, and 
      advertising interventions). CONCLUSION: Successful strategies from other disciplines 
      could be considered by palliative care researchers. Tailored, efficient, 
      evidence-based strategies must be developed, acknowledging that strategies with face 
      validity are not necessarily the most effective.

TI  - Understanding opioid overdose characteristics involving prescription and illicit 
      opioids: A mixed methods analysis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid abuse and misuse are significant public health issues. The CDC 
      estimated 72% of pharmaceutical-related overdose deaths in the US in 2012 involved 
      opioids. While studies of opioid overdoses have identified sociodemographic 
      characteristics, agents used, administration routes, and medication sources 
      associated with overdoses, we know less about the context and life circumstances of 
      the people who experience these events. METHODS: We analyzed interviews (n=87) with 
      survivors of opioid overdoses or family members of decedents. Individuals 
      experiencing overdoses were members of a large integrated health system. Using ICD 
      codes for opioid overdoses and poisonings, we identified participants from five 
      purposefully derived pools of health-plan members who had: 1) prescriptions for 
      OxyContin(®) or single-ingredient sustained-release oxycodone, 2) oxycodone 
      single-ingredient immediate release, 3) other long-acting opioids, 4) other 
      short-acting opioids, or 5) no active opioid prescriptions. RESULTS: Individuals who 
      experienced opioid overdoses abused and misused multiple medications/drugs; 
      experienced dose-related miscommunications or medication-taking errors; had mental 
      health and/or substance use conditions; reported chronic pain; or had unstable 
      resources or family/social support. Many had combinations of these risks. Most 
      events involved polysubstance use, often including benzodiazepines. Accidental 
      overdoses were commonly the result of abuse or misuse, some in response to 
      inadequately treated chronic pain or, less commonly, medication-related mistakes. 
      Suicide attempts were frequently triggered by consecutive negative life events. 
      CONCLUSIONS: To identify people at greater risk of opioid overdose, efforts should 
      focus on screening for prescribed and illicit polysubstance use, impaired cognition, 
      and changes in life circumstances, psychosocial risks/supports, and pain control.

TI  - Stability of Geriatric Syndromes in Hospitalized Medicare Beneficiaries Discharged 
      to Skilled Nursing Facilities.
PG  - 2027-2034
LID - 10.1111/jgs.14320 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess multiple geriatric syndromes in a sample of older hospitalized 
      adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and subsequently to home to 
      determine the prevalence and stability of each geriatric syndrome at the point of 
      these care transitions. DESIGN: Descriptive, prospective study. SETTING: One large 
      university-affiliated hospital and four area SNFs. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-eight 
      hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries discharged to SNFs (N = 58). MEASUREMENTS: 
      Research personnel conducted standardized assessments of the following geriatric 
      syndromes at hospital discharge and 2 weeks after SNF discharge to home: cognitive 
      impairment, depression, incontinence, unintentional weight loss, loss of appetite, 
      pain, pressure ulcers, history of falls, mobility impairment, and polypharmacy. 
      RESULTS: The average number of geriatric syndromes per participant was 4.4 ± 1.2 at 
      hospital discharge and 3.8 ± 1.5 after SNF discharge. There was low to moderate 
      stability for most syndromes. On average, participants had 2.9 syndromes that 
      persisted across both care settings, 1.4 syndromes that resolved, and 0.7 new 
      syndromes that developed between hospital and SNF discharge. CONCLUSION: Geriatric 
      syndromes were prevalent at the point of each care transition but also reflected 
      significant within-individual variability. These findings suggest that multiple 
      geriatric syndromes present during a hospital stay are not transient and that most 
      syndromes are not resolved before SNF discharge. These results underscore the 
      importance of conducting standardized screening assessments at the point of each 
      care transition and effectively communicating this information to the next provider 
      to support the management of geriatric conditions.

TI  - Understanding gastrointestinal distress: a framework for clinical practice.
PG  - 380-5
LID - 10.1038/ajg.2010.383 [doi]
AB  - We describe a framework to help clinicians think about health-related quality of 
      life in their gastrointestinal (GI) patients. We introduce "GI distress" as a 
      clinically relevant concept and explain how it may result from physical symptoms, 
      cognitions, and emotions. The GI distress framework suggests that providers should 
      divide GI physical symptoms into four categories: pain, gas/bloat, altered 
      defecation, and foregut symptoms. We describe how these physical symptoms can be 
      amplified by maladaptive cognitions, including external locus of control, 
      catastrophizing, and anticipation anxiety. We suggest determining the level of 
      embarrassment from GI symptoms and asking about stigmatization. GI patients may also 
      harbor emotional distress from their illness and may exhibit visceral anxiety marked 
      by hypervigilance, fear, and avoidance of GI sensations. Look for signs of 
      devitalization, indicated by inappropriate fatigue. When appropriate, screen for 
      suicidal ideations. Finally, we provide a list of high-yield questions to screen for 
      these maladaptive cognitions and emotions, and explain how the GI distress framework 
      can be used in clinical practice.

TI  - Risk of heart failure and edema associated with the use of pregabalin: a systematic 
      review.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-2-25 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pregabalin is used in the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia, diabetic 
      neuropathic pain, partial seizures, anxiety disorders and fibromyalgia. Recognized 
      adverse effects associated with its use include cognitive impairment, somnolence and 
      dizziness. Heart failure associated with pregabalin has been described, however the 
      strength of this association has not been well characterized. To examine this 
      further, we will conduct a systematic review of the risk of heart failure and edema 
      associated with use of pregabalin. METHODS/DESIGN: We will include all studies 
      (experimental, quasi-experimental, observational, case series/reports, drug 
      regulatory reports) that examine the use of pregabalin compared to placebo, 
      gabapentin or conventional care. Our primary outcome is heart failure and the 
      secondary outcomes include edema and weight gain. We will search electronic 
      databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), and 
      grey literature sources (trial registries, conference abstracts) to identify 
      relevant studies. To ensure literature saturation, we will contact drug 
      manufacturers, conduct forward citation searching, and scan the reference lists of 
      key articles and included studies. We will not restrict inclusion by language or 
      publication status.Two reviewers will screen citations (titles and abstracts) and 
      full-text articles, conduct data abstraction, and appraise risk of bias. 
      Random-effects meta-analysis will be conducted if the studies are deemed 
      heterogeneous in terms of clinical, statistical and methodological factors but still 
      suitable for meta-analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review will assist 
      physicians to better appreciate pregabalin's risk for edema or congestive heart 
      failure and will be pertinent to the thousands of patients worldwide who are 
      administered this medication.Our protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database 
      (CRD42012002948).

TI  - The association of bullying and health complaints in children with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 62-8
LID - 10.3810/pgm.2010.09.2202 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in schoolchildren is 
      often associated with troublesome relationships with family members and peers as 
      well as difficulties in the classroom. The aims of this study were to assess the 
      associations between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), recurrent 
      subjective health complaints, and bullying in the peer group in schoolchildren. 
      METHOD: Cohort study of 577 fourth graders (10-year-olds) in 1 municipality in 
      Stockholm County, Sweden. All children were screened for attention and behavior 
      problems through interviews with their parents and teachers. Children with high 
      scores underwent further clinical and cognitive assessments. Information about 
      health complaints and bullying was collected from the children themselves in a 
      classroom questionnaire. The 516 children for whom there was information from all 3 
      data sources were included in the final study population. RESULTS: 
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was associated with a 2-fold increased risk 
      for recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), sleeping problems, and tiredness, while there 
      was no association with headache. Bullying other students as well as being bullied 
      were strongly associated with ADHD. There was a 2-fold increased risk for all kinds 
      of health complaints among children being bullied, while bullies were more likely to 
      report tiredness than other children. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation and treatment 
      strategies for ADHD need to include an effective evaluation and treatment of RAP, 
      tiredness, and sleeping disturbances as well as assessment and effective 
      interventions for bullying. Evaluation of ADHD should be considered in children with 
      recurrent health complaints and in children involved in bullying. Antibullying 
      interventions are important to prevent health problems in all children.

TI  - Psychometric properties of the Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS) index: a 
      national web-based study of fibromyalgia.
PG  - S49-54
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a generalized chronic pain condition that is often accompanied 
      by symptoms such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, psychological and cognitive 
      alterations, headache, migraine, variable bowel habits, diffuse abdominal pain, and 
      urinary frequency. Its key assessment domains include pain, fatigue, disturbed 
      sleep, physical and emotional functioning, and patient global satisfaction and 
      health-related quality of life (HRQL). A number of evaluation measures have been 
      adapted from the fields of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing 
      spondylitis, and others such as the Fibromyalgia Assessment Status (FAS) index and 
      the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) have been specifically developed. The 
      aim of this study was to assess the impact of FM on HRQL by comparing the 
      performance of the FAS index, the FIQ and the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ] 
      in 541 female and 31 male FM patients (mean age 50 years; mean disease duration 7.7 
      years) entered in the database of a web-based survey registry developed by the 
      Italian Fibromyalgia Network (IFINET). Tests of convergent validity showed that the 
      FAS index and FIQ significantly correlated with each other (rho=0.608, p<0.0001), 
      but there were also significant correlations between the FAS index and other 
      clinical measures of disability, including the HAQ (rho=0.423, p<0.0001), anxiety 
      (rho=0.138, p=0.0009), depression (rho=0.174, p<0.0001) and, especially, the number 
      of comorbidities (rho=0.147, p=0.0004). The FAS index revealed a statistically 
      significant difference between males and females (p=0.048), analysed using the 
      Mann-Whitney U-test for all pair wise comparisons. The FAS index is a valid 
      three-item instrument (pain, fatigue and sleep disturbances) that performs at least 
      as well as the FIQ in FM patients, and is simpler to administer and score. Both 
      questionnaires may be useful when screening FM patients, with the choice of the most 
      appropriate instrument depending on the setting.

TI  - What Aspects of Quality of Life Are Important From Palliative Care Patients' 
      Perspectives? A Systematic Review of Qualitative Research.

AB  - CONTEXT: Despite the availability of numerous tools professing to measure quality of 
      life (QOL) in the palliative care setting, no single instrument includes all 
      patient-valued domains. OBJECTIVES: To identify which aspects of QOL are important 
      from palliative care patients' perspectives, aiding coverage, and content validity 
      evaluation of available tools. METHODS: A systematic review and synthesis of 
      qualitative research was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for 
      Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. ASSIA, CINAHL, Cochrane library, 
      Embase, Medline, PsycINFO, and PubMed were searched from database inception to 
      December 31, 2015. Published, peer-reviewed, English-language articles reporting 
      primary qualitative data investigating QOL domains in adults with a progressive, 
      life-limiting illness were included. Studies a priori exploring a chosen aspect of 
      QOL were not included. Articles scoring ≤2 on reporting quality were excluded. 
      Framework synthesis was used to identify key themes across the studies. RESULTS: 
      Overall, 3589 articles were screened and 24 studies were included. Eight important 
      aspects of QOL were identified: physical; personal autonomy; emotional; social; 
      spiritual; cognitive; healthcare; and preparatory. All but one study discussed 
      spiritual aspects, whereas only six studies mentioned cognitive aspects. CONCLUSION: 
      A broad range of domains are important to the QOL of people with life-limiting 
      illnesses receiving palliation. Refinement of measures is needed to help ensure 
      services address issues valued by patients such as preparation for death and aspects 
      of health care provision, elements which are seldom included in currently available 
      preference-based measures used to inform value for money decisions in palliative 
      care.

TI  - The role of parent psychological flexibility in relation to adolescent chronic pain: 
      further instrument development.
PG  - 235-46
LID - S1526-5900(14)01069-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jpain.2014.11.013 [doi]
AB  - Parental responses to their child's pain are associated with the young person's 
      functioning. Psychological flexibility--defined as the capacity to persist with or 
      change behavior, depending on one's values and the current situation, while 
      recognizing cognitive and noncognitive influences on behavior--may provide a basis 
      for further investigating the role of these responses. The Parent Psychological 
      Flexibility Questionnaire (PPFQ) is a promising but preliminary measure of this 
      construct. Parents of 332 young people with pain (301 mothers, 99 fathers, 68 dyads) 
      completed the PPFQ during appointments in a pediatric pain clinic. Initial item 
      screening eliminated 6 of the 31 items. Mothers' and fathers' data were then 
      subjected to separate principal components analyses with oblique rotation, resulting 
      in a 4-factor solution including 17 items, with subscales suggesting Values-Based 
      Action, Pain Acceptance, Emotional Acceptance, and Pain Willingness. The PPFQ 
      correlated significantly with adolescent-rated pain acceptance, functional 
      disability, and depression. Differences were observed between mothers' and fathers' 
      PPFQ scores, in particular, those related to school absence and fears of physical 
      injury. The 17-item PPFQ appears reasonable for research and clinical use and may 
      potentially identify areas for intervention with parents of young people with 
      chronic pain. PERSPECTIVE: Parent psychological flexibility, as measured by the 
      PPFQ, appears relevant to functioning, depression, and pain acceptance in 
      adolescents with chronic pain. This model may help tie parental responses to 
      adolescent distress and disability and may help clarify the development and 
      maintenance of disability within the context of chronic pain.

TI  - Validation of the brief cognitive symptoms index in Sjögren syndrome.
PG  - 2027-33
LID - 10.3899/jrheum.140362 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Brief Cognitive Symptoms Inventory (BCSI) is a short, self-report 
      scale designed to measure cognitive symptomatology in patients with rheumatic 
      disease. To facilitate research and clinical practice, we tested the internal 
      consistency and validity of the BCSI in patients with Sjögren syndrome (SS). 
      METHODS: Patients who met the American-European Consensus Group criteria for SS and 
      healthy controls completed a questionnaire assessing symptoms including cognitive 
      complaints. We calculated Cronbach's alpha to assess internal consistency and 
      Pearson correlation coefficients to test for association between BCSI, symptoms, and 
      demographic variables. Total score distribution was analyzed to establish cutoff 
      criteria for differentiation of case versus non-case. We compared neuropsychological 
      outcomes of patients with SS above and below the threshold BCSI score to assess the 
      association of cognitive symptoms with objective cognitive deficits. RESULTS: 
      Complete data were available on 144 patients with SS and 35 controls. Internal 
      consistency of the BCSI was good. Scores were similar in all patient groups and 
      patients reported more cognitive symptoms than controls (p < 0.0001). BCSI scores 
      correlated moderately with pain, depression, anxiety, fatigue, and health quality. 
      High scores for cognitive dysfunction were reported by 20% of the patients with SS 
      and only 3% of controls. Patients with cognitive scores > 50 had more depression, 
      fatigue, pain (effect size all > 1), and worse performance on multiple cognitive 
      domains. CONCLUSION: The BCSI should be a useful tool for the study of cognitive 
      symptoms in SS. Both self-report and standardized tests should be considered in 
      screening for cognitive disorders in SS.

TI  - A clinical screening protocol for the RSVP Keyboard brain-computer interface.
PG  - 11-8
LID - 10.3109/17483107.2013.836684 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To propose a screening protocol that identifies requisite sensory, motor, 
      cognitive and communication skills for people with locked-in syndrome (PLIS) to use 
      the RSVP Keyboard™ brain-computer interface (BCI). METHOD: A multidisciplinary 
      clinical team of seven individuals representing five disciplines identified 
      requisite skills for the BCI RSVP Keyboard™. They chose questions and subtests from 
      existing standardized instruments for auditory comprehension, reading and spelling, 
      modified them to accommodate nonverbal response modalities, and developed novel 
      tasks to screen visual perception, sustained visual attention and working memory. 
      Questions were included about sensory skills, positioning, pain interference and 
      medications. The result is a compilation of questions, adapted subtests and original 
      tasks designed for this new BCI system. It was administered to 12 PLIS and 6 healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: Administration required 1 h or less. Yes/no choices and eye gaze 
      were adequate response modes for PLIS. Healthy controls and 9 PLIS were 100% 
      accurate on all tasks; 3 PLIS missed single items. CONCLUSIONS: The RSVP BCI 
      screening protocol is a brief, repeatable technique for patients with different 
      levels of LIS to identify the presence/absence of skills for BCI use. Widespread 
      adoption of screening methods should be a clinical goal and will help standardize 
      BCI implementation for research and intervention. Implications for Rehabilitation 
      People with locked-in syndrome must have certain sensory, motor, cognitive and 
      communication skills to successfully use a brain-computer interface (BCI) for 
      communication. A screening profile would be useful in identifying potentially 
      suitable candidates for BCI.

TI  - Depressive symptoms and associated factors in an older Spanish population positively 
      screened for disability.
PG  - 745-55
LID - 10.1002/gps.3886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its association 
      with a comprehensive set of variables and to study the potential modifying effects 
      of sex and age. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, subjects who tested positive to 
      the 12-item World Health Organization disability screening tool were selected from a 
      probabilistic sample of persons aged 65 years or older in a rural area of Spain. 
      Measurements included EURO-D depression scale, socio-demographics, habits, 
      anthropometrics, medical history, cognition, disability, functional dependence, 
      self-rated health and pain. Logistic regression models were used to obtain adjusted 
      odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for the association 
      between depression and variables. The modifying effects of age and sex were 
      assessed. RESULTS: Prevalence (95% CI) of current depressive symptoms among the 438 
      participants was 35.8% (31.3-40.3%). Depressive symptomatology was higher among 
      women (aOR = 2.98). An inverse association was observed with alcohol (aORs of 0.52 
      and 0.27 for consumption of 1-2 and >2 standard units/day, respectively, versus 
      abstainers). Depressive symptomatology was associated with heart failure (aOR = 
      4.24), urinary incontinence (aOR = 2.68), ischemic heart disease (aOR = 1.87), poor 
      self-rated health and pain. Sex and age modified the effect of several variables. 
      CONCLUSION: Prevalence of depressive symptoms, albeit high, was less than expected. 
      The consistently strong negative association between depressive symptoms and alcohol 
      consumption warrants further in-depth research. Awareness of effect modification by 
      key variables, such as sex and age, may enable the probability of suffering 
      depression to be more accurately assessed, with a view to performing a potential 
      diagnostic work-up.

TI  - Refinement of the symptom screening in pediatrics tool (SSPedi).
PG  - 1262-8
LID - 10.1038/bjc.2014.445 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Objective was to evaluate and refine a new instrument for paediatric 
      cancer symptom screening named the Symptom Screening in Pediatrics Tool (SSPedi). 
      METHODS: Respondents were children 8-18 years of age undergoing active cancer 
      treatment and parents of eligible children. Respondents completed SSPedi once and 
      then responded to semi-structured questions. They rated how easy or difficult SSPedi 
      was to complete. For items containing two concepts, we asked respondents whether 
      concepts should remain together or be separated into two questions. We also asked 
      about each item's importance and whether items were missing. Cognitive probing was 
      conducted in children to evaluate their understanding of items and the response 
      scale. After each group of 10 children and 10 parents, responses were reviewed to 
      determine whether modifications were required. Recruitment ceased with the first 
      group of 10 children in which modifications were not required. RESULTS: Thirty 
      children and 20 parents were required to achieve a final version of SSPedi. Fifteen 
      items remain in the final version; the score ranges from 0 to 60. CONCLUSIONS: Using 
      opinions of children with cancer and parents of paediatric cancer patients, we 
      successfully developed a symptom screening tool that is easy to complete, is 
      understandable and demonstrates content validity.

TI  - Prevalence of menopausal symptoms in Asian midlife women: a systematic review.
PG  - 157-76
LID - 10.3109/13697137.2014.937689 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To systematically review published articles for the prevalence of 
      menopausal symptoms in Asian women. METHODS: A comprehensive and systematic 
      literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS and 
      Google scholar in June 2013 to retrieve all English-language studies that included 
      information on the prevalence of menopausal symptoms in women living in Asian 
      countries. Risk of bias of included studies was assessed using a risk-of-bias tool 
      explicitly designed for the systematic review of prevalence studies. RESULTS: 
      Twenty-three independent studies met our inclusion criteria. Physical symptoms were 
      the most prevalent symptoms compared to psychological, vasomotor and sexual 
      symptoms. There was a wide variation in the prevalence of all symptoms across the 
      menopausal stages due to the differences in modes of recruitment, study design, 
      sampling procedures, the time frame over which symptoms were assessed and use of 
      different diagnostic or screening tools. A high level of bias was observed for both 
      external and internal validity for most studies. CONCLUSION: Although there is a 
      wide variation in the reported prevalence of menopausal symptoms, physical symptoms 
      predominate, followed by psychological symptoms, vasomotor symptoms and sexual 
      symptoms. Further studies of representative samples are necessary to understand 
      whether the variations in prevalence reporting are a function of methodological 
      issues or due to ethnic, cultural or other socioeconomic differences.

TI  - Therapeutic Efficacy of Home-Use Photobiomodulation Devices: A Systematic Literature 
      Review.
LID - 10.1089/pho.2018.4512 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Perform systematic literature review on photobiomodulation (PBM) devices 
      used at home for nonesthetic applications. BACKGROUND: Home-use PBM devices have 
      been marketed for cosmetic and therapeutic purposes. This is the first systematic 
      literature review for nonesthetic applications. METHODS: A systematic literature 
      search was conducted for PBM devices self-applied at home at least thrice a week. 
      Two independent reviewers screened the articles and extracted the data. Treatment 
      dosage appropriateness was compared to the World Association for Laser Therapy 
      (WALT) recommendations. The efficacy was evaluated according to the relevant primary 
      end-point for the specific indication. RESULTS: Eleven studies were suitable. 
      Devices were applied for a range of indications, including pain, cognitive 
      dysfunction, wound healing, diabetic macular edema, and postprocedural side effects, 
      and were mostly based on near-infrared, pulsed light-emitting diodes with dosages 
      within WALT recommendations. Regarding efficacy, studies reported mostly positive 
      results. CONCLUSIONS: Home-use PBM devices appear to mediate effective, safe 
      treatments in a variety of conditions that require frequent applications. Conclusive 
      evaluation of their efficacy requires additional, randomized controlled studies.

TI  - An assistant workforce to improve screening rates and quality of care for older 
      patients in the emergency department: findings of a pre- post, mixed methods study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Older people who present to the Emergency Department (ED) experience 
      high rates of prevalent and incident delirium. This study aimed to determine whether 
      an assistant workforce in the ED could effectively conduct screening to inform 
      assessment and care planning for older people as well as enhance supportive care 
      activities for prevention of delirium. METHODS: Using a pre-post design, data was 
      collected before and after the introduction of Older Person Technical Assistants 
      (OPTAs) in the ED. OPTA activity was recorded during the intervention period and a 
      medical record audit undertaken prior to and 9 months after implementation. Data 
      were analysed using descriptive statistics for OPTA activities. Weighted Kappa 
      scores were calculated comparing concordance in screening scores between OPTAs and 
      Aged Services Emergency Team Registered Nurses. Changes in the rates of documented 
      screening and supportive care were analysed using Chi-square tests. Focus groups 
      were conducted to explore clinicians' experiences of the OPTA role. RESULTS: Three 
      thousand five hundred fourty two people were seen by OPTAs in 4563 ED Presentations 
      between 1st July 2011 and 2012. The reproducibility of all screening tools were 
      found to be high between the OPTAs and the RNs, with Kappas and ICCs generally all 
      above 0.9. The medical record audit showed significant improvement in the rates of 
      documented screening, including cognition from 1.5 to 38% (p < 0.001) and review of 
      pain from 29 to 75% (p < 0.001). Supportive care such as being given fluids or food 
      also improved from 13 to 49% (p < 0.001) and pressure care from 4.8 to 30% 
      (p < 0.001). This was accomplished with no increase in ED length of stay among this 
      age group. Focus group interviews described mixed responses and support for the OPTA 
      role. CONCLUSIONS: An assistant workforce in an ED setting was found to provide 
      comparable screening results and improve the rates of documented screening and 
      supportive care provided to older people with or at risk of developing delirium in 
      the ED. There is a need for a shared philosophy to the care of older people in the 
      ED. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registration number

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a rheumatic syndrome characterised by chronic widespread pain, often 
      associated with fatigue, unrefreshed sleep and cognitive problems. Effective 
      management of fibromyalgia requires a proactive approach in which the patient takes 
      responsibility for self-care. The purpose of this research was to develop an 
      application (app) for promoting self-care as a complementary Mobile Health resource 
      to physical therapy in the management of fibromyalgia. The app was developed in five 
      stages, according to the prototyping paradigm. In Stage 1, an expert panel of five 
      physical therapists, five patients with fibromyalgia, a digital interface designer 
      and a programmer analysed the requirements and content, and set the software 
      objectives. In Stage 2, the designer created the screen layouts. In Stage 3, the 
      programmer developed the prototype for the Android operating system (Google Inc., 
      Mountain View, CA, USA). In Stage 4, the prototype was pilot tested regarding its 
      quality of use by 10 patients with fibromyalgia. Finally, in Stage 5, the designer 
      improved the interface and the programmer built the final product. This article 
      describes the development of ProFibro, the first free mobile app in Brazilian 
      Portuguese for fibromyalgia. Its functions are patient education through animation, 
      self-monitoring, sleep strategies, scheduling, graded exercise programme, practice 
      of gratitude, family adjustments and hints through notifications.

TI  - Problems and unmet needs of patients discharged "home to self-care".
PG  - 240-50; quiz 251-2
LID - 10.1097/NCM.0b013e31822361d8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF STUDY: The purpose of this study was to determine the extent to which 
      patients discharged "home to self care" experienced problems and unmet needs. A 
      secondary aim was to explore potential differences in problems and unmet needs 
      between medical and surgical patients. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: The study setting 
      was acute care in 2 hospitals that were part of a large academic medical center in 
      the Midwest. METHODOLOGY AND SAMPLE: The prospective, cohort survey study was 
      designed with a systematic sampling strategy to identify 130 cognitively intact 
      adults hospitalized for either medical or surgical reasons who planned to return 
      home after discharge without formal community services. The hospital information 
      system was checked daily to verify whether dispositions were coded "home to self 
      care," and to verify whether the patients were not seen by a discharge planner. The 
      Problems After Discharge Questionnaire-English Version (PADQ-E) was then either 
      mailed or administered via a phone interview approximately 1 week after discharge. 
      RESULTS: Overall, 73.8% wanted more information about one or more topics related to 
      their care. Most frequently mentioned were "when they would be completely recovered" 
      (38.0%) and "where and how they could get nursing care at home if they needed it" 
      (36.9%). A majority (91.8%) reported difficulties related to at least 1 physical 
      complaint. Pain was most frequently mentioned by surgical patients (88.1%). Getting 
      tired quickly was an issue for both surgical (76.2%) and medical patients (62.8%). 
      More than 85% received help at home from family or friends. Surgical patients 
      received significantly more assistance than medical patients with personal care, 
      household activities, and mobility. Approximately 1 in 4 surgical patients reported 
      an unmet need within the Physical Complaints subscale on the PADQ-E. IMPLICATIONS 
      FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: Potential problems that may occur after discharge have 
      little chance of getting addressed if not identified during the discharge planning 
      process. Standardized, early screening to accurately identify patients at risk for 
      unmet needs after discharge is critical to the development and implementation of a 
      quality discharge plan. The lack of time available to hospital clinicians to 
      assemble and interpret extensive and complex information calls for improved methods 
      to support identifying patients at risk for poor outcomes, engaging discharge 
      planners efficiently and accurately, providing a standardized assessment to identify 
      and address continuing care needs, and identifying patients who would benefit from 
      post-acute care. Case managers advance their practice by advocating for and 
      participating in the development of improved methods.

AB  - Antepartum anemia impacts over a third of pregnant women globally and is associated 
      with major maternal and perinatal morbidity, including peripartum transfusion, 
      maternal death, maternal infection, preterm birth, and neurodevelopmental disorders 
      among offspring. Postpartum anemia impacts up to 80% of women in low-income and 
      rural populations and up to 50% of women in Europe and the United States, and is 
      associated with postpartum depression, fatigue, impaired cognition, and altered 
      maternal-infant bonding. Iron deficiency is the most common cause of maternal anemia 
      because of insufficient maternal iron stores at the start of pregnancy, increased 
      pregnancy-related iron requirements, and iron losses due to blood loss during 
      parturition. Anemic women should undergo testing for iron deficiency; a serum 
      ferritin cutoff level of 30 μg/L is commonly used to diagnose iron deficiency during 
      pregnancy. The first-line treatment of iron deficiency is oral iron. Intravenous 
      iron is a consideration in the following scenarios: a poor or absent response to 
      oral iron, severe anemia (a hemoglobin concentration <80 g/L), rapid treatment for 
      anemia in the third trimester, women at high risk for major bleeding (such as those 
      with placenta accreta), and women for whom red blood cell transfusion is not an 
      option. Given the high prevalence of antepartum and postpartum anemia, 
      anesthesiologists are advised to partner with other maternal health professionals to 
      develop anemia screening and treatment pathways.

TI  - Self-reported quality of sleep is associated with bodily pain, vitality and 
      cognitive impairment in Japanese older adults.
PG  - 628-35
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12149 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Poor sleep can affect physical and mental health, and consequently people's 
      quality of life (QOL); however, only a few studies have addressed the potential 
      associations of physical and mental health with quality of sleep (QOS) in Japan. The 
      present study aimed to investigate the association of QOS with sociodemographic and 
      lifestyle characteristics, cognitive status, nutrition, depression, seclusion, and 
      QOL in Japanese community-dwelling older adults. METHODS: Data were collected 
      through self-administered questionnaires and other specific tests in 145 (age 73 
      years [range 70-77 years]) participants. The χ(2) -test or Fisher's exact test were 
      used to compare categorical variables stratified by QOS, and the Mann-Whitney U-test 
      was used for continuous variables. Furthermore, logistic regression analyses were 
      carried out to verify the associations with QOS. RESULTS: The poor QOS group had 
      more males (P < 0.05), a shorter self-reported sleep duration (P < 0.001), higher 
      body mass index (P < 0.05) and higher risk of depression (P < 0.05), whereas the 
      good QOS group showed higher scores in the QOL summary and domains of physical 
      component (P < 0.01), general health (P < 0.001), bodily pain (P < 0.001) and 
      vitality (P < 0.001). In the logistic regression model, cognitive status (OR 0.13, 
      95% CI 0.03-0.55), bodily pain (OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.84-1.00) and vitality (OR 0.82, 
      95% CI 0.73-0.92) were associated with QOS. CONCLUSION: The present study provides 
      evidence that QOS is linked to cognitive status, bodily pain and vitality in 
      Japanese older adults. We maintain that screening a person's sleep characteristics 
      in a community setting might be relevant to identify those older adults at risk of a 
      poor QOL and frailty in the early phase, triggering further health analyses.

AB  - The current study had two objectives. (1) to compare objective and self-report 
      measures in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) according to the 1994 
      Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria, patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), 
      and healthy controls, and (2) to contrast CFS patients who only fulfill CDC criteria 
      to those who also fulfill the criteria for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), the 2003 
      Canadian criteria for ME/CFS, or the comorbid diagnosis of fibromyalgia (FM). One 
      hundred six participants (48 CFS patients diagnosed following the 1994 CDC criteria, 
      19 MS patients, and 39 healthy controls) completed questionnaires assessing symptom 
      severity, quality of life, daily functioning, and psychological factors. Objective 
      measures consisted of activity monitoring, evaluation of maximal voluntary 
      contraction and muscle recovery, and cognitive performance. CFS patients were 
      screened whether they also fulfilled ME criteria, the Canadian criteria, and the 
      diagnosis of FM. CFS patients scored higher on symptom severity, lower on quality of 
      life, and higher on depression and kinesiophobia and worse on MVC, muscle recovery, 
      and cognitive performance compared to the MS patients and the healthy subjects. 
      Daily activity levels were also lower compared to healthy subjects. Only one 
      difference was found between those fulfilling the ME criteria and those who did not 
      regarding the degree of kinesiophobia (lower in ME), while comorbidity for FM 
      significantly increased the symptom burden. CFS patients report more severe symptoms 
      and are more disabled compared to MS patients and healthy controls. Based on the 
      present study, fulfillment of the ME or Canadian criteria did not seem to give a 
      clinically different picture, whereas a diagnosis of comorbid FM selected 
      symptomatically worse and more disabled patients.

TI  - Identifying elders with neuropsychiatric problems in a clinical setting.
PG  - S24-30
LID - 10.4103/0976-3147.116438 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Multiple health problems among the elderly necessitate a comprehensive 
      enquiry to detect problems early and also initiate treatment. We utilized available 
      validated instruments to comprehensively identify older persons with 
      neuro-psychiatric problems including dementia and comorbid medical ailments in the 
      screening desk of the geriatric clinic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Individuals aged 60 
      years and above seeking outpatient care at NIMHANS during a 2-year period (October 
      2008-September 2010) participated. We used General Health Questionnaire (12-item), 
      AD8, questions to identify psychoses and neurological problems and a checklist of 
      common medical ailments. A probable clinical diagnosis was made at the end by 
      medical personnel based on ICD-10. RESULTS: A total of 5,260 individuals were 
      screened and more than one-third (36.7%) were women. About 50% had psychological 
      distress (≥2 on GHQ-12), 20.1% had probable cognitive impairment (≥2 on AD8) and 
      about 17% had symptoms suggestive of psychoses (≥1 on Psychoses screener). More than 
      65% had either a neurological or neurosurgical problems (≥1 on Neurological 
      screener) and headache was the commonest complaint. At probable diagnosis, more than 
      50% had a neurological problem and over 30% had psychiatric disorders. Of these the 
      most common psychiatric illnesses were psychotic disorders (22.0%), mood disorders 
      (21.4%) and dementia (14.4%). The most common medical comorbidity included 
      hypertension (36.4%), visual impairment (31.8%) and joint pains (30.5%). Nearly 80% 
      had one or more medical comorbidity in addition to psychiatric illness. The overall 
      set of instruments took about 15-20 minutes. It systematically and comprehensively 
      guided in evaluating the elderly for neuropsychiatric problems and hence was 
      collated to constitute the Instruments for Comprehensive Evaluation of the Elderly 
      (ICE-E). CONCLUSIONS: ICE-E was brief, easy to administer and improved decision 
      making even by personnel from a non-medical background. The instrument aided in 
      systematically detecting neuro-psychiatric problems among the elderly (including 
      psychological distress and cognitive changes) and other medical comorbidities.

TI  - Detecting chronic solvent encephalopathy in occupations at risk.
PG  - 734-41
LID - 10.1016/j.neuro.2012.04.018 [doi]
AB  - Chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE) is under-reported worldwide due to difficulties 
      in recognition and differences in national legislation. Although its occurrence in 
      developed countries has declined, new cases continue to be detected. Our aim was to 
      determine whether CSE can be detected in risk trades, using a stepwise screening 
      procedure. Another aim was to evaluate if this method detects more cases than 
      present occupational health service (OHS) practices do in Finland, a country with 
      decreasing exposures, high OHS coverage and an annual rate of around forty cases of 
      suspected CSE and seven cases of occupational CSE. The studied fields, based on the 
      national occurrence of CSE, were industrial and construction painting, floor 
      layering, the printing press industry, boat construction, reinforced plastic 
      laminating and the metal industry. We obtained contact information from trade union 
      registers and municipal OHS. A postal survey including the Euroquest (EQ) neurotoxic 
      symptom questionnaire, Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Alcohol Use 
      Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (Audit-C), and questions on exposure and 
      medical conditions, was sent to 3,640 workers in the age range of 30-65 years in two 
      Finnish provinces. The survey resulted in 1,730 responses (48%). This was followed 
      by a clinical examination, with methods applicable to OHS, of subjects fulfilling 
      the criteria: three or more EQ memory and concentration symptoms and sufficient 
      exposure, a BDI score≤18, an AUDIT-C score≤8, and no evident medical condition 
      explaining their symptoms. Of 338 respondents with memory and concentration 
      symptoms, 129 subjects fulfilled all the criteria, of which 83 participated in 
      clinical examinations. We found 38 CSE compatible cases. The study shows that more 
      CSE compatible cases can be detected when the screening is directed towards the 
      occupational fields at greatest risk. This stepwise method is more effective for 
      finding CSE compatible cases than regular OHS activity. The number of cases was 
      similar to the total annual occurrence, of new CSE-suspected cases, although the 
      sample represented approximately 18% of the abundantly exposed workforce in Finland. 
      Combining of exposure and medical differential diagnostics to neurotoxic symptom 
      questionnaire, decreases the amount of cases needing clinical examinations. This 
      two-step procedure can be carried out with methods suitable for OHS and other 
      primary health care, both in industrialized and developed countries.

AB  - Stroke, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), traumatic brain injuries (TBI) and neuropathies are 
      the most important diseases in neurological rehabilitation financed by the German 
      Pension Insurance. The primary goal is vocational (re)integration. Driven by 
      multiple findings of neuroscience research the traditional holistic approach with 
      mainly empirically derived strategies was developed further and improved by new 
      evidence-based interventions. This process had been, and continues to be, necessary 
      to meet the health-economic pressures for ever shorter and more efficient rehab 
      measures. Evidence-based interventions refer to symptom-oriented measures, to 
      team-management concepts, as well as to education and psychosocial interventions. 
      Drug therapy and/or neurophysiological measures can be added to increase 
      neuroregeneration and neuroplasticity. Evidence-based aftercare concepts support 
      sustainability and steadiness of rehab results.Mirror therapy, robot-assisted 
      training, mental training, task-specific training, and above all constraint-induced 
      movement therapy (CIMT) can restore motor arm and hand functions. Treadmill training 
      and robot-assisted training improve stance and gait. Botulinum toxine injections in 
      combination with physical and redressing methods are superior in managing 
      spasticity. Guideline-oriented management of associated pain syndromes (myofascial, 
      neuropathic, complex-regional=dystrophic) improve primary outcome and quality of 
      life. Drug therapy with so-called co-analgetics and physical therapy play an 
      important role in pain management. Swallowing disorders lead to higher mortality and 
      morbidity in the acute phase; stepwise diagnostics (screening, endoscopy, radiology) 
      and specific swallowing therapy can reduce these risks and frequently can restore 
      normal eating und drinking.In our modern industrial societies communicative and 
      cognitive disturbances are more impairing than the above mentioned disorders. Speech 
      and language therapy (SLT) is dominant in communicative disorders; the therapists 
      use communicative and/or linguistics-oriented strategies. SLT must begin early after 
      disease onset and with high frequency to elicit good results. PC-assisted 
      (self-)training, possibly telemedically applied, can increase training frequency and 
      time and, hence, improve outcome in aphasia. High-frequency and task-specific 
      training, often PC-assisted, were found to be relevant for improving cognitive 
      functions in all dimensions. Several strategies seem to be efficient in neglect. 
      Visual field deficits can be treated restitutively and compensatingly by PC-assisted 
      training. Attention, memory and executive dysfunctions each require multimodal 
      specific treatment strategies, performed in single and group therapy and in 
      PC-assisted training. Also, education of patients to cope with their impairments and 
      disabilities is another important part. Combined medically and vocationally oriented 
      rehabilitation settings are necessary for raising the rate of return-to-work, 
      especially in patients with motor hand impairments or cognitive disorders. Education 
      of patients and relatives to cope with the chronic neurological diseases and 
      disablements highly improve the sustainability of rehab results and can, in the long 
      run, also reduce mortality and admission to nursing homes. Appropriate physical 
      activity and sports are relevant in the phase of aftercare, by stabilizing both 
      motor coordination and cognitive factors; in MS patients fatigue can be diminished 
      effectively.The main mental comorbidities are anxiety and depression. 
      Pharmacological and psychological treatments have been found to be equally important 
      in this context. Frequently, these mental disorders appear in the phase of aftercare 
      and long-term course only, then worsening outcome sustainability. Efficient concepts 
      to deal with this aspect are still missing. The ambulatory health care system can 
      not cope with it until now.The multitude of evidence-based interventions have over 
      the last 20 years after the Rehab Commission of the Federation of the German Pension 
      Insurance Institutes contributed decisively to even improving primary outcomes and 
      quality of life of neurological patients in spite of shortened length of stay and 
      other restrictions. Neurorehabilitative research, especially the clinically oriented 
      part, had a major influence on the process of professionalization of all members in 
      the neurorehabilitative team. This fact enables new and more efficient 
      organizational structures and working processes within the team; the discussion on 
      this topic has however only just started.

TI  - Low use of mental health services among older Americans with mood and anxiety 
      disorders.
PG  - 66-72
LID - 10.1176/appi.ps.201100121 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is unclear why late-life mood and anxiety disorders are highly 
      undertreated, despite being common among older adults. Thus this study examined 
      prevalence of and key factors associated with nonuse of mental health services among 
      older community-dwelling adults with these disorders. METHODS: The sample included 
      348 participants aged 55 years or older who met 12-month criteria for DSM-IV mood 
      and anxiety disorders and responded to the National Comorbidity Survey Replication 
      (NCS-R), a population-based probability sample. Analyses included frequency measures 
      and logistic regression with weights and complex design-corrected statistical tests. 
      Key factors associated with not using mental health services were determined in a 
      final multivariable model based on a systematic approach that accounted for a 
      comprehensive list of potential predictors. RESULTS: Approximately 70% of older 
      adults with mood and anxiety disorders did not use services. Those who were from 
      racial-ethnic minority groups, were not comfortable with discussing personal 
      problems, were married or cohabitating, and had middle- versus high-income status 
      had increased odds of not using mental health services. In addition, respondents 
      with mild versus serious disorders, no chronic pain complaints, and low versus high 
      perceived cognitive impairment had greater odds of nonuse. CONCLUSIONS: Results 
      indicate that improvements are needed in the following areas to combat the very high 
      number of mood and anxiety disorders that go untreated in older Americans: awareness 
      of need, comfort in discussing personal problems with a health care professional, 
      and screening and other prevention efforts.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite the growing importance of slow gait as a universal screen of 
      health, systematic investigation of risk factors for incident slow gait is lacking. 
      Our objective was to identify potentially modifiable risk factors for incident slow 
      gait. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: The Health and Retirement Study, a 
      nationally representative US sample. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2306 individuals age 
      65 and older (56.5% women) from the 2008 wave with timed walks at baseline and 
      4 years later. MEASUREMENTS: Incident slow gait (walking speed 1 SD below age and 
      sex means) was the outcome. Fifteen potentially modifiable medical and lifestyle 
      risk factors were examined as predictors. RESULTS: Incident slow gait developed in 
      243 participants (11%) at 4 years. Physical inactivity (adjusted relative risk [aRR] 
      1.94), cognitive impairment (aRR 1.77), muscle weakness (aRR 1.48), pain (aRR 1.45), 
      obesity (aRR 1.35), vision (aRR 1.36), and falls (aRR 1.32) predicted increased risk 
      of developing incident slow gait. Together, these risk factors accounted for 77% 
      (95% confidence interval 14-95) of the Population Attributable Risk for incident 
      slow gait. CONCLUSION: A limited set of potentially modifiable risk factors is 
      associated with new-onset slow gait in older adults. These findings provide a 
      foundation for developing clinical guidelines and preventive interventions for slow 
      gait.

TI  - A Narrative Review of the Assessment of Depression in Chronic Pain.
LID - S1524-9042(21)00122-3 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.pmn.2021.03.009 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This narrative review sought to explore the main critical issues in the 
      assessment of depression in chronic pain and to identify self-report tools that can 
      be reliably used for measuring it. DESIGN: Narrative review of the literature. 
      METHODS: Articles were obtained through a search of three databases and a hand 
      search of the references of full-text papers. Key results within the retrieved 
      articles were summarized and integrated to address the review objectives. RESULTS: 
      Criterion contamination, different ways to define and evaluate pain and depression 
      across studies, variability in chronic pain samples and settings, pitfalls of 
      diagnostic systems and self-reports, and reluctance to address (or difficulty of 
      recognizing) depression in patients and healthcare providers emerged as main 
      critical issues. The Beck Depression Inventory seems to be the more accurate tool to 
      evaluate depression in chronic pain patients, while other instruments such as the 
      Patient Health Questionnaire could be recommended for a rapid screening. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of depression comorbidity in chronic pain represents a 
      challenge in both research and clinical practice; the choice and use of tests, as 
      well as the score interpretation, require clinical reasoning. NURSING PRACTICE 
      IMPLICATIONS: Nurses play an important role in screening for depression. Cognitive 
      contents of depression should be carefully evaluated since somatic symptoms may be 
      confusing in the chronic pain context. Some self-reports may be useful for rapid 
      screening. It is also advisable to consider other relevant patient information in 
      evaluating depression.

TI  - Endoscopic sinus surgery improves cognitive dysfunction in patients with chronic 
      rhinosinusitis.
PG  - 1264-1272
LID - 10.1002/alr.21820 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) have been found to have 
      cognitive deficit, as identified using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ), 
      but the exact etiology of cognitive decline is unknown. In this study we aimed to 
      determine whether improvement in concomitant inflammation and disease burden in CRS, 
      using endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), improves cognitive deficit. We also sought to 
      identify comorbid conditions that effect improvement likelihood. METHODS: Study 
      participants (n = 247) with and without nasal polyposis (CRSwNP, CRSsNP) were 
      prospectively enrolled in this multi-institutional, observational outcomes study. 
      Pre- and postoperative cognitive dysfunction was evaluated using the CFQ instrument. 
      Quality of life (QOL) and disease burden was also evaluated using the Rhinosinusitis 
      Disability Index (RSDI), the 22-item SinoNasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), nasal 
      endoscopy, computed tomography, and the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). 
      RESULTS: Average CFQ total scores improved significantly (p = 0.012) after ESS for 
      patients with follow-up (n = 141). Participants with CRSwNP (n = 51) reported 
      significant postoperative improvements in mean CFQ total scores (p = 0.002) and CFQ 
      distractibility and blunders domain scores (p ≤ 0.006). No significant postoperative 
      improvement for any average CFQ score was found in CRSsNP (p > 0.086). The magnitude 
      of postoperative improvement in CFQ total and domain mean scores was statistically 
      similar between CRSsNP and CRSwNP (p > 0.115). Depressive disorder, identified using 
      PHQ-2 screening, was the only comorbid condition significantly associated with 
      measurable cognitive deficit (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CRS have 
      measurable cognitive decline, and ESS may modestly improve cognitive deficit/CFQ 
      scores. Future investigations are needed to further elucidate the underlying 
      mechanisms responsible for cognitive deficit in patients with CRS and significant 
      associations with depression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Hypersexual Disorder Screening Inventory (HDSI) was developed by 
      the American Psychiatric Association for clinical screening of hypersexual disorder 
      (HD). AIMS: To examine the distribution of the proposed diagnostic entity HD 
      according to the HDSI in a sample of men and women seeking help for problematic 
      hypersexuality and evaluate some psychometric properties. METHODS: Data on 
      sociodemographics, the HDSI, the Sexual Compulsivity Scale (SCS), and the Cognitive 
      and Behavioral Outcomes of Sexual Behavior were collected online from 16 women and 
      64 men who self-identified as hypersexual. Respondents were recruited by 
      advertisements offering psychological treatment for hypersexual behavior. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: The HDSI, covering the proposed criteria for HD. RESULTS: Of the 
      entire sample, 50% fulfilled the criteria for HD. Compared with men, women scored 
      higher on the HDSI, engaged more often in risky sexual behavior, and worried more 
      about physical injuries and pain. Men primarily used pornography, whereas women had 
      sexual encounters. The HD group reported a larger number of sexual specifiers, 
      higher scores on the SCS, more negative effects of sexual behavior, and more 
      concerns about consequences compared with the non-HD group. Sociodemographics had no 
      influence on HD. The HDSI's core diagnostic criteria showed high internal 
      reliability for men (α = 0.80) and women (α = 0.81). A moderate correlation between 
      the HDSI and the SCS was found (0.51). The vast majority of the entire sample (76 of 
      80, 95%) fulfilled the criteria for sexual compulsivity according to the SCS. 
      CONCLUSION: The HDSI could be used as a screening tool for HD, although further 
      explorations of the empirical implications regarding criteria are needed, as are 
      refinements of cutoff scores and specific sexual behaviors. Hypersexual problematic 
      behavior causes distress and impairment and, although not included in the Diagnostic 
      and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, HD should be endorsed as 
      a diagnosis to develop evidence-based treatment and future studies on its etiology.

AB  - The cholinergic nuclei in the basal forebrain innervate frontal cortical structures 
      regulating attention. Our aim was to investigate if cognitive test results measuring 
      attention relate to the longitudinal volume change of cholinergically innervated 
      structures following traumatic brain injury (TBI). During the prospective, 
      observational TBIcare project patients with all severities of TBI (n = 114) and 
      controls with acute orthopedic injuries (n = 17) were recruited. Head MRI was 
      obtained in both acute (mean 2 weeks post-injury) and late (mean 8 months) time 
      points. T1-weighted 3D MR images were analyzed with an automatic segmentation method 
      to evaluate longitudinal, structural brain volume change. The cognitive outcome was 
      assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). 
      Analyses included 16 frontal cortical structures, of which four showed a significant 
      correlation between post-traumatic volume change and the CANTAB test results. The 
      strongest correlation was found between the volume loss of the supplementary motor 
      cortex and motor screening task results (R-sq 0.16, p < 0.0001), where poorer test 
      results correlated with greater atrophy. Of the measured sum structures, greater 
      cortical gray matter atrophy rate showed a significant correlation with the poorer 
      CANTAB test results. TBI caused volume loss of frontal cortical structures that are 
      heavily innervated by cholinergic neurons is associated with neuropsychological test 
      results measuring attention.

PG  - 2149-2153
LID - 10.4103/1673-5374.310672 [doi]
AB  - Frailty is a critical intermediate status of the aging process with a 
      multidimensional and multisystem nature and at higher risk for adverse 
      health-related outcomes, including falls, disability, hospitalizations, 
      institutionalization, mortality, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease. Among different 
      frailty phenotypes, oral frailty has been recently suggested as a novel construct 
      defined as a decrease in oral function with a coexisting decline in cognitive and 
      physical functions. We briefly reviewed existing evidence on operational definitions 
      of oral frailty, assessment and screening tools, and possible relationships among 
      oral frailty, oral microbiota, and Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration. Several 
      underlying mechanism may explain the oral health-frailty links including 
      undernutrition, sarcopenia linked to both poor nutrition and frailty, psychosocial 
      factors, and the chronic inflammation typical of oral disease. Oral microbiota may 
      influence Alzheimer's disease risk through circulatory or neural access to the brain 
      and the interplay with periodontal disease, often causing tooth loss also linked to 
      an increased Alzheimer's disease risk. On this bases, COR388, a bacterial protease 
      inhibitor targeting Porphyromonas gingivalis implicated in periodontal disease, is 
      now being tested in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II/III study in 
      mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, oral status may be an important 
      contributor to general health, including Alzheimer's disease and late-life cognitive 
      disorders, suggesting the central role of preventive strategies targeting the novel 
      oral frailty phenotype and including maintenance and improvement of oral function 
      and nutritional status to reduce the burden of both oral dysfunction and frailty.

AB  - The purpose of the project was to assess whether the first spontaneous movements of 
      a computer mouse, when making an assessment on a scale presented on the screen, may 
      express a respondent's implicit attitudes. In Study 1, the altruistic behaviors of 
      66 students were assessed. The students were led to believe that the task they were 
      performing was also being performed by another person and they were asked to 
      distribute earnings between themselves and the partner. The participants performed 
      the tasks under conditions with and without distractors. With the distractors, in 
      the first few seconds spontaneous mouse movements on the scale expressed a selfish 
      distribution of money, while later the movements gravitated toward more altruism. In 
      Study 2, 77 Polish students evaluated a painting by a Polish/Jewish painter on a 
      scale. They evaluated it under conditions of full or distracted cognitive abilities. 
      Spontaneous movements of the mouse on the scale were analyzed. In addition, implicit 
      attitudes toward both Poles and Jews were measured with the Implicit Association 
      Test (IAT). A significant association between implicit attitudes (IAT) and 
      spontaneous evaluation of images using a computer mouse was observed in the group 
      with the distractor. The participants with strong implicit in-group favoritism of 
      Poles revealed stronger preference for the Polish painter's work in the first few 
      seconds of mouse movement. Taken together, these results suggest that spontaneous 
      mouse movements may reveal egoism (in-group favoritism), i.e., processes that were 
      not observed in the participants' final decisions (clicking on the scale).

TI  - Functional status after critical illness: agreement between patient and proxy 
      assessments.
PG  - 506-10
LID - 10.1093/ageing/afu163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: assessment of baseline functional status of older patients during and 
      after intensive care unit (ICU) admission is often hampered by challenges related to 
      the critical illness such as cognitive dysfunction, neuropsychological morbidity and 
      pain. To explore the reliability of assessments by carefully chosen proxies, we 
      designed a discriminating selection of proxies and evaluated agreement between 
      patient and proxy responses by assessing activities of daily living (ADLs) at 1 
      month post-ICU discharge. METHODS: patients ≥60 years old admitted to the medical 
      ICU were enrolled in a prospective parent cohort studying delirium. Proxies were 
      carefully screened at ICU admission to choose the best available respondent. 
      Follow-up interviews, including instruments for ADLs, were conducted 1 month after 
      ICU discharge. We examined 179 paired patient-proxy follow-up interviews. Kappa 
      statistics assessed inter-observer agreement, and McNemar's exact test assessed 
      response differences. RESULTS: patients averaged 73.3 ± 8.1 years old with 29% 
      having evidence of cognitive impairment. Proxies were most commonly spouses (38%) or 
      children (39%). Overall, there was substantial (κ ≥ 0.6) to excellent agreement (κ ≥ 
      0.8) between patients and proxies on assessment of all but one basic and one 
      instrumental ADL. CONCLUSION: proxies carefully chosen at ICU admission show high 
      levels of inter-observer agreement with older patients when assessing current 
      functional status at 1 month post-ICU discharge. This motivates further study of 
      proxy assessments that could be used earlier in critical illness to assess premorbid 
      functional status.

TI  - Do expectancies of return to work and Job satisfaction predict actual return to work 
      in workers with long lasting LBP?
PG  - 481
LID - 481
AB  - BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal disorders including low back pain have major individual 
      and socioeconomic consequences as it often leads to disability and long-term sick 
      leave and exclusion from working life. Predictors of disability and return to work 
      often differ, and the dominant knowledge is on predictors for prolonged sick leave 
      and disability. Therefore it is also important to identify key predictors for return 
      to work. The aim of the study was to assess if overall job satisfaction and 
      expectancies of return to work predicts actual return to work after 12 months, among 
      employees with long lasting low back pain, and to assess if there were gender 
      differences in the predictors. METHODS: Data from the Cognitive interventions and 
      nutritional supplements trial (CINS Trial) was used. Predictors for return to work 
      were examined in 574 employees that had been on sick leave 2-10 months for low back 
      pain, before entering the trial. Data were analysed with multiple logistic 
      regression models stratified by gender, and adjusted for potential confounders. 
      RESULTS: Regardless of gender high expectancies were a strong and significant 
      predictor of return to work at 12 months, while high levels of job satisfaction were 
      not a significant predictor. There were no differences in the levels of expectancies 
      or overall job satisfaction between men and women. However, men had in general 
      higher odds of returning to work compared with women. CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals 
      with long lasting low back pain high expectancies of returning to work were strongly 
      associated with successful return to work. We do not know what factors influence 
      individual expectancies of return to work. Screening expectancies and giving 
      individuals with low expectancies interventions with a goal to change expectancies 
      of return to work, such as CBT or self-management interventions, may contribute to 
      increase actual return to work. TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ , 
      with registration number NCT00463970 . The trial was registered at the 18th of April 
      2007.

TI  - Reprogramming cells from Gulf War veterans into neurons to study Gulf War illness.
PG  - 1968-1975
LID - 10.1212/WNL.0000000000003938 [doi]
AB  - Gulf War illness (GWI), which afflicts at least 25% of veterans who served in the 
      1990-1991 war in the Persian Gulf, is thought to be caused by deployment exposures 
      to various neurotoxicants, including pesticides, anti-nerve gas pills, and low-level 
      nerve agents including sarin/cyclosarin. GWI is a multisymptom disorder 
      characterized by fatigue, joint pain, cognitive problems, and gastrointestinal 
      complaints. The most prominent symptoms of GWI (memory problems, poor 
      attention/concentration, chronic headaches, mood alterations, and impaired sleep) 
      suggest that the disease primarily affects the CNS. Development of urgently needed 
      treatments depends on experimental models appropriate for testing mechanistic 
      hypotheses and for screening therapeutic compounds. Rodent models have been useful 
      thus far, but are limited by their inability to assess the contribution of genetic 
      or epigenetic background to the disease, and because disease-vulnerable proteins and 
      pathways may be different in humans relative to rodents. As of yet, no postmortem 
      tissue from the veterans has become available for research. We are moving forward 
      with a paradigm shift in the study of GWI, which utilizes contemporary stem cell 
      technology to convert somatic cells from Gulf War veterans into pluripotent cell 
      lines that can be differentiated into various cell types, including neurons, glia, 
      muscle, or other relevant cell types. Such cell lines are immortal and will be a 
      resource for GWI researchers to pursue mechanistic hypotheses and therapeutics.

TI  - Lead and children: clinical management for family physicians.
PG  - 531-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide family physicians with a practical, evidence-based approach to 
      screening for and preventing children's exposure to lead. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: 
      MEDLINE was searched using terms relevant to lead exposure and poisoning. We 
      reviewed English-language articles published in 2003 to 2008. Most cited studies 
      provide level 2 or 3 evidence. MAIN MESSAGE: Lead is a developmental neurotoxin. 
      Children are most commonly exposed and they are most vulnerable. Lead exposure has 
      been associated with many cognitive and motor deficits, as well as distractibility 
      and other characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Although 
      children's blood lead levels have declined considerably over the past 3 decades with 
      removal of lead from gasoline and paint, children can still be exposed to lead from 
      lead paint in older homes, toys, and other sources. Because post-exposure treatment 
      cannot reverse the cognitive effects of lead exposure, preventing lead exposure is 
      essential. CONCLUSION: Family physicians have an important role in screening for 
      children at high risk of lead exposure, and in educating families to prevent the 
      exposure of children to lead.

TI  - Further delineation of the MECP2 duplication syndrome phenotype in 59 French male 
      patients, with a particular focus on morphological and neurological features.
PG  - 359-371
LID - 10.1136/jmedgenet-2017-104956 [doi]
AB  - The Xq28 duplication involving the MECP2 gene (MECP2 duplication) has been mainly 
      described in male patients with severe developmental delay (DD) associated with 
      spasticity, stereotypic movements and recurrent infections. Nevertheless, only a few 
      series have been published. We aimed to better describe the phenotype of this 
      condition, with a focus on morphological and neurological features. Through a 
      national collaborative study, we report a large French series of 59 affected males 
      with interstitial MECP2 duplication. Most of the patients (93%) shared similar 
      facial features, which evolved with age (midface hypoplasia, narrow and prominent 
      nasal bridge, thick lower lip, large prominent ears), thick hair, livedo of the 
      limbs, tapered fingers, small feet and vasomotor troubles. Early hypotonia and 
      global DD were constant, with 21% of patients unable to walk. In patients able to 
      stand, lower limbs weakness and spasticity led to a singular standing habitus: 
      flexion of the knees, broad-based stance with pseudo-ataxic gait. Scoliosis was 
      frequent (53%), such as divergent strabismus (76%) and hypermetropia (54%), 
      stereotypic movements (89%), without obvious social withdrawal and decreased pain 
      sensitivity (78%). Most of the patients did not develop expressive language, 35% 
      saying few words. Epilepsy was frequent (59%), with a mean onset around 7.4 years of 
      age, and often (62%) drug-resistant. Other medical issues were frequent: 
      constipation (78%), and recurrent infections (89%), mainly lung. We delineate the 
      clinical phenotype of MECP2 duplication syndrome in a large series of 59 males. 
      Pulmonary hypertension appeared as a cause of early death in these patients, 
      advocating its screening early in life.

TI  - Quality of life in Malaysian colorectal cancer patients: a preliminary result.
PG  - 957-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rapidly increasing colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence in Malaysia and the 
      introduction of cutting edge new treatments, which prolong survival, mean that 
      treatment outcome measures meed to be evaluated, including consideration of 
      patient's quality of life (QoL) assessment. There are limited data on QoL in CRC 
      patients, especially in Malaysia. Therefore, this study was performed focusing on 
      cancer stages and age groups. METHODS: The cross sectional study was conducted from 
      June to September 2011 at three public tertiary hospitals with the EORTC QLQ C-30 
      questionnaire in addition to face to face interview and review of medical records of 
      100 respondents. RESULTS: The mean age was 57.3 (SD 11.9) years with 56.0% are males 
      and 44.0% females, 62% of Malay ethnicity, 30% Chinese, 7% Indian and 1% Sikh. 
      Majority were educated up to secondary level (42%) and 90% respondents had CRC 
      stages III and IV. Mean global health status (GHS) score was 79.1 (SD 21.4). Mean 
      scores for functional status (physical, emotional, role, cognitive, social) rangeds 
      between 79.5 (SD 26.6) to 92.2 (SD 13.7). Mean symptom scores (fatigue, pain, 
      nausea/vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, insomnia, dyspnoea, loss of appetite) 
      ranged between 4.00 (SD 8.58) to 20.7 (SD 30.6). Respondents role function 
      significantly deteriorates with increasing stage of the disease (p=0.044). Females 
      had worse symptoms of pain (p=0.022), fatigue (p=0.031) and dyspnoea (p=0.031). Mean 
      insomnia (p=0.006) and diarrhea (p=0.024) demonstrated significant differences 
      between age groups. CONCLUSION: QOL in CRC patients in this study was comparable to 
      that in other studies done in developed countries. Pain, fatigue and dyspnoea are 
      worse among female CRC patients. Given that functions deteriorates with advanced 
      stage of the disease at diagnosis, a systematic screening programme to detect cases 
      as early as possible is essential nationwide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the self-reported version of the Inventory of 
      Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-SR), which is used for major depression, is a 
      reliable tool for screening and assessment of prenatal depression. METHODS: Between 
      June 2006 and July 2008, pregnant women attending a teaching hospital in São Paulo, 
      Brazil, completed the Portuguese version of the IDS-SR. Trained psychologists 
      diagnosed depression via the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders 
      questionnaire, which is based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders IV. RESULTS: Of 543 participants, 60 (11%) were diagnosed with depression. 
      The Cronbach α of the IDS-SR was 0.89, and the area under the ROC curve was 0.8. The 
      IDS-SR cutoff score at 30 gave a sensitivity and specificity of 78% and 76%, 
      respectively, for diagnosis of prenatal depression. Exploratory and confirmatory 
      analyses revealed a 2-factor structure for the IDS-SR, characterized by symptoms of 
      "mood/cognition" and "irritability/anxiety/pain". CONCLUSION: The IDS-SR gave 
      satisfactory internal consistency and accuracy for diagnosing prenatal depression, 
      showing that it can improve early diagnosis and treatment of this condition, thereby 
      minimizing the burden. In addition, a 2-factor model was found to account for 
      depressive symptomatology during pregnancy, which will be useful for developing 
      further depression subscales specific to prenatal depression.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipedema is a type of subcutaneous adipose tissue disorder that affects 
      mainly women. Its main symptom is bilateral fat accumulation on the extremities with 
      associated pain in the affected areas. Despite growing interest in lipedema among 
      patients and medical health professionals, lipedema is still often misdiagnosed, 
      misunderstood, and mistreated. To promote better understanding of lipedema, we aimed 
      to investigate factors related to the quality of life and describe selected 
      sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of women with lipedema in Poland. 
      METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional online survey that was completed by 98 women 
      with lipedema. The participants responded to questionnaires regarding quality of 
      life, sociodemographic and clinical characteristics, and depression symptom 
      severity. RESULTS: The participants reported low quality of life and high severity 
      of depressive symptoms. The more severe the symptoms related to pain, heaviness, and 
      swelling, the lower the quality of life. Further analyses showed that depression 
      severity mediated this relationship. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides initial 
      information on screening questions, lipedema symptoms, and comorbidities, pointing 
      to the areas needing in-depth investigation. Further steps to improve quality of 
      life in women with lipedema and to reduce health costs should include the education 
      of medical health professionals, using diagnostic tools that allow for 
      differentiation among diagnoses and precise health risk assessment, and creating 
      Polish treatment guidelines for lipedema.

TI  - Can the cognitively impaired safely use patient-controlled analgesia?
PG  - 307-12
AB  - Although patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is considered the standard in 
      postoperative pain control, research examining PCA use among cognitively impaired 
      older adults is lacking. The authors reviewed a case series of 10 adults aged 65 
      years and older admitted to the geriatrics or orthopedic services of an urban 
      tertiary care center in New York City with acute pain and cognitive impairment or 
      dementia who were administered PCA. Four patients from this cohort are presented in 
      detail, demonstrating the challenges of PCA use in this population. A series of 
      clinical pearls follows each case, outlining strategies for improving pain 
      management. The authors' findings suggest that cognitive evaluations limited to 
      alertness and orientation and failure to perform functional assessments may binder 
      the identification of patients who are poor candidates for PCA. Once PCA has been 
      initiated, clinicians must regularly review device use and document cognitive 
      function and pain score patterns to identify PCA underuse or misuse. Finally, rapid 
      fluctuations in cognitive or functional status may require adoption of a more 
      flexible pain management strategy. Despite these challenges, a subset of cognitively 
      impaired older adults can successfully understand and operate PCA devices. 
      Additional research is needed to (1) develop screening tools for identifying and 
      monitoring older adults who may benefit from PCA and (2) create innovative 
      approaches for improving pain management in the cognitively impaired.

      japonica.
PG  - e966
LID - 10.1371/journal.pntd.0000966 [doi]
LID - e966
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Chinese government lists advanced schistosomiasis as a leading 
      healthcare priority due to its serious health and economic impacts, yet it has not 
      been included in the estimates of schistosomiasis burden in the Global Burden of 
      Disease (GBD) study. Therefore, the quality of life and disability weight (DW) for 
      the advanced cases of schistosomiasis japonica have to be taken into account in the 
      re-estimation of burden of disease due to schistosomiasis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL 
      FINDINGS: A patient-based quality-of-life evaluation was performed for advanced 
      schistosomiasis japonica. Suspected or officially registered advanced cases in a 
      Schistosoma japonicum-hyperendemic county of the People's Republic of China (P.R. 
      China) were screened using a short questionnaire and physical examination. 
      Disability and morbidity were assessed in confirmed cases, using the European 
      quality of life questionnaire with an additional cognitive dimension (known as the 
      "EQ-5D plus"), ultrasonography, and laboratory testing. The age-specific DW of 
      advanced schistosomiasis japonica was estimated based on patients' self-rated health 
      scores on the visual analogue scale of the questionnaire. The relationships between 
      health status, morbidity and DW were explored using multivariate regression models. 
      Of 506 candidates, 215 cases were confirmed as advanced schistosomiasis japonica and 
      evaluated. Most of the patients reported impairments in at least one health 
      dimension, such as pain or discomfort (90.7%), usual activities (87.9%), and anxiety 
      or depression (80.9%). The overall DW was 0.447, and age-specific DWs ranged from 
      0.378 among individuals aged 30-44 years to 0.510 among the elderly aged ≥ 60 years. 
      DWs are positively associated with loss of work capacity, psychological abnormality, 
      ascites, and active hepatitis B virus, while splenectomy and high albumin were 
      protective factors for quality of life. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These 
      patient-preference disability estimates could provide updated data for a revision of 
      the GBD, as well as for evidence-based decision-making in P.R. China's national 
      schistosomiasis control program.

TI  - Postoperative Delirium in Elderly Patients Undergoing Major Spinal Surgery: Role of 
      Cerebral Oximetry.
PG  - 426-432
LID - 10.1097/ANA.0000000000000363 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Perioperative cerebral hypoperfusion/ischemia is a major inciting factor 
      of postoperative delirium, which is coupled with adverse outcome in elderly 
      patients. Cerebral oximetry enables noninvasive assessment of the regional cerebral 
      oxygen saturation (rSO2). This study aimed to investigate whether perioperative rSO2 
      variations were linked to delirium in elderly patients after spinal surgery. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postoperative delirium was assessed for 48 hours postsurgery 
      in 109 patients aged over 60 years without a prior history of cerebrovascular or 
      psychiatric diseases by the Confusion Assessment Method for the intensive care unit 
      and the intensive care delirium screening checklist. The rSO2 values immediately 
      before and throughout surgery were acquired. The preoperative cognitive functions, 
      patient characteristics, and perioperative data were recorded. RESULTS: During the 
      48-h postoperative period, 9 patients (8%) exhibited delirium. The patients with 
      delirium showed similar perioperative rSO2 values as those without, in terms of the 
      median lowest rSO2 values (55% vs. 56%; P=0.876) and incidence (22%, both) and 
      duration of decline of rSO2<80% of the baseline values. The serially assessed 
      hemodynamic variables, hematocrit levels, and blood gas analysis variables were also 
      similar between the groups, except for the number of hypotensive events per patient, 
      which was higher in the patients with delirium than in those without (4, 
      interquartile range [IQR] 3 to 6 vs. 2, IQR: 1to 3; P=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The 
      degree and duration of decrease of the perioperative rSO2 measurements were not 
      associated with delirium in elderly patients after spinal surgery.

AB  - The impact of cerebrovascular events (CVE) on cognitive functioning in adults with 
      sickle cell disease is not well understood. Sequelae of CVEs can adversely impact 
      their quality of life. We reviewed neurocognitive presentation and testing in adults 
      with sickle cell disease. We evaluated the frequency of complaints of memory 
      disturbance using survey methodology in a sample of 109 adult patients with sickle 
      cell disease (48 males, 61 females). A subsample of 24 patients also received a 
      memory questionnaire where specific cognitive functions were assessed. Overall, we 
      found that males and females did not differ in the frequency of experienced memory 
      disturbance during painful crises. However, the frequency of men reporting that 
      their ability to remember where they place common objects such as keys (p = 0.017) 
      and remembering the item they intended to buy in a grocery store or pharmacy (p = 
      0.048) was worse now compared to when they were in high school and was greater when 
      compared to women. The frequency of men who reported their memory was worse now than 
      when they were in high school (p = 0.051) was also greater than in women. We 
      concluded that memory dysfunction predicts global monthly presentation of pain. We 
      suggest incorporating cost-effective neurocognitive screening measures as a standard 
      of practice in sickle cell disease.

TI  - Intrathecal baclofen therapy for severe spasticity: analysis on a series of 112 
      consecutive patients and future prospectives.
PG  - 321-5

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intrathecal baclofen therapy (ITB) is a well-known treatment for 
      spasticity. Despite this fact, several topics have to be still discussed: new 
      indications and screening tools, appropriate surgical timing and complicance 
      avoidance. METHODS: A total of 112 consecutive patients all with a severe, 
      progressive and refractory to medical therapy spasticity from different causes were 
      treated using ITB, after a bolus test. Every patient was assessed by means of 
      Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Penn spasm frequency scale (SFS) and Visual Analog 
      Scale for pain. Since available, a Gait analysis was also performed. RESULTS: There 
      were 63 males (56%) and 49 females (44%). Seventy-four (66%) had a quadriparesis, 34 
      (30.4%) had a paraparesis and 4 (3.6%) were hemiplegic. Among these patients 77 
      (68.7%) were non ambulatory, while 35 (31.3%) were ambulatory. These patients 
      suffered from spasticity due to many different diseases. Mean follow-up was 55 
      months. The mean Modified Ashworth score decreased from 4.5±0.5 preoperatively to 
      1.2±0.4 on chronic intrathecal baclofen. Daily baclofen dose varied between 23 and 
      500 mcg. Drug-induced complications and catheter related problems occurred, 
      respectively in 7 (6.3%) and 10 patients (8.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Although ITB is a well 
      known and good treatment option in the management of severe spasticity, because of 
      the different goals and subgroups of patients treated, a variety of techniques are 
      needed to evaluate the benefits of this therapy. New indications, effects of ITB on 
      central nervous system and cognitive functions needs yet to be fully clarified.

TI  - Tourniquet use in total knee replacement surgery: a feasibility study and pilot 
      randomised controlled trial (SAFE-TKR study).
PG  - e043564
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043564 [doi]
LID - e043564
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tourniquets are routinely used during total knee replacement (TKR) 
      surgery. They could increase the risk of thromboembolic events including cerebral 
      emboli, cognitive decline, pain and other adverse events (AEs). A randomised 
      controlled trial to assess whether tourniquet use might safely be avoided is 
      therefore warranted but it is unclear whether such a trial would be feasible. 
      METHODS: In a single-site feasibility study and pilot randomised controlled trial, 
      adults having a TKR were randomised to surgery with an inflated tourniquet versus a 
      non-inflated tourniquet. Participants underwent brain MRI preoperatively and within 
      2 days postoperatively. We assessed cognition using the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Oxford Cognitive Screen 
      (OCS) and thigh pain using a Visual Analogue Scale at baseline and days 1 and 2, and 
      1 week postsurgery. AEs related to surgery were recorded up to 12 months. RESULTS: 
      We randomised 53 participants (27 tourniquet inflated and 26 tourniquet not 
      inflated). Fifty-one participants received care per-protocol (96%) and 48 (91%) were 
      followed up at 12 months. One new ischaemic brain lesion was detected. Of the 
      cognitive tests, MoCA was easy to summarise, sensitive to change with lower ceiling 
      effects compared with OCS and MMSE. There was a trend towards more thigh pain (mean 
      49.6 SD 30.4 vs 36.2 SD 28 at day 1) and more AEs related to surgery (21 vs 9) in 
      participants with an inflated tourniquet compared with those with a tourniquet not 
      inflated. CONCLUSION: A full trial is feasible, but using MRI as a primary outcome 
      is unlikely to be appropriate or feasible. Suitable primary outcomes would be 
      cognition measured using MoCA, pain and AEs, all of which warrant investigation in a 
      large multicentre trial. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN20873088.

TI  - Delirium monitoring in the ICU: strategies for initiating and sustaining screening 
      efforts.
PG  - 179-88
LID - 10.1055/s-0033-1342972 [doi]
AB  - Delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with many negative outcomes, 
      including increased length of stay in both the ICU and the hospital, increased 
      duration of mechanical ventilation, increased mortality, worse long-term cognitive 
      impairment, and increased costs. The 2013 American College of Critical Care Medicine 
      (ACCM)/Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) clinical practice guidelines for 
      pain, agitation, and delirium (PAD), based on available evidence, strongly recommend 
      that critically ill patients be routinely monitored for delirium in the ICU using a 
      validated tool. After conducting a thorough psychometric review of available 
      delirium assessment tools, the 2013 PAD guideline group concluded that the Confusion 
      Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) and the Intensive Care Delirium Screening 
      Checklist (ICDSC) are the ICU delirium screening tools with the strongest validity 
      and reliability. This article discusses the importance and feasibility of delirium 
      screening in the ICU and compares the most commonly used critical care delirium 
      screening instruments. Strategies needed to implement and sustain delirium screening 
      efforts in different critically ill populations are introduced and discussed. 
      Accurate detection is the first step in managing ICU patients who develop delirium 
      in an attempt to reduce the negative sequelae of delirium in this population.

TI  - Dysphoria is a risk factor for depression in medically ill older people.
PG  - 1233-1240
LID - 10.1002/gps.4432 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depression in older people is commonly under diagnosed and is associated 
      with increased morbidity and mortality. Because older people currently occupy 65% of 
      acute hospital beds, it is crucial for them to be properly assessed for depression 
      to optimise their medical care. The aim of this study was to identify potential risk 
      factors for depression in the medically ill in order to improve their inpatient 
      care. METHODS: This was a 2-year observational study of consequent referrals to the 
      Newcastle Liaison Team for Older Adults. Out of a total number of 1586 referred 
      patients, 1197 were included in the final analysis of data. Information about their 
      age, main medical history, cognitive impairment and use of antidepressants was 
      collected. All subjects were screened for dementia, depression and delirium. 
      Proportions were compared using the chi-squared test. Clinical depression as a 
      binary variable was modelled using logistic regression. RESULTS: Higher risk for 
      depression was associated with pain (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76; p = 0.033) and a 
      previous history of depression (OR = 2.22; p < 0.001). Cognitive impairment 
      (OR = 0.44, p < 0.001) and delirium (OR = 0.49; p < 0.001) decreased the likelihood 
      for having depression. Subjective feelings of emptiness, being unhappy and depressed 
      alone (R(2)  = 37.4%) and cognitive impairment (R(2)  = 39.5%) were the best 
      multivariable model to explain depression in medically ill people. CONCLUSION: 
      Dysphoric mood results in depression in older people with medical health problems.

LID - 10.1016/j.aprim.2010.05.019 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to translate and culturally adapt the original 
      version of the STarT Back Screening Tool (SBST) to Spanish for different population 
      subgroups. DESIGN: Translation and cultural adaptation of a questionnaire. SETTING: 
      Primary care settings. METHOD: Thirty-eight people distributed by: gender; adults 
      and elderly; and with or without pain. Phases: a) Forward translation 
      (English-Spanish); b) Evaluation of the clarity, the acceptability and the 
      familiarity of the content of the obtained Spanish version by means of cognitive 
      interviews to participants, and c) Translation of the final Spanish version of the 
      questionnaire back into the original language. RESULTS: The participants interviewed 
      indicated that most of the items of the questionnaire were clear and comprehensible, 
      showing greater difficulty in understanding in the dimensions of disability and 
      anxiety. Furthermore, the questionnaire was more difficult to understand by the 
      elderly and patients with a previous non-specific low back pain episode. CONCLUSION: 
      The Spanish version of the SBST questionnaire was obtained, which was shown to be 
      comprehensible and adapted to the general population in Spain. Due to being short 
      and easy to use, it is a potentially useful tool for use in primary care.

TI  - Preoperative Cognitive Stratification of Older Elective Surgical Patients: A 
      Cross-Sectional Study.
PG  - 186-92
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000001277 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Preexisting cognitive impairment is emerging as a predictor of poor 
      postoperative outcomes in seniors. We hypothesized that preoperative cognitive 
      screening can be performed in a busy preadmission evaluation center and that 
      cognitive impairment is prevalent in elective geriatric surgical patients. METHODS: 
      We approached 311 patients aged 65 years and older presenting for preoperative 
      evaluation before elective surgery in a prospective, observational, single-center 
      study. Forty-eight patients were ineligible, and 63 declined. The remaining 200 were 
      randomly assigned to the Mini-Cog (N =100) or Clock-in-the-Box [CIB; N = 100)] test. 
      Study staff administered the test in a quiet room, and 2 investigators scored the 
      tests independently. Probable cognitive impairment was defined as a Mini-Cog ≤ 2 or 
      a CIB ≤ 5. RESULTS: The age of consenting patients was 73.7 ± 6.4 (mean ± SD) years. 
      There were no significant differences between patients randomly assigned to the 
      Mini-Cog and CIB test in age, weight, gender, education, ASA physical status, or 
      Charlston Index. Overall, 23% of patients met criteria for probable cognitive 
      impairment, and prevalence was virtually identical regardless of the test used; 22% 
      screened with the Mini-Cog and 23% screened with the CIB scored as having probable 
      cognitive impairment (P = 1.0 by χ analysis). Both tests had good interrater 
      reliability (Krippendroff α = 0.86 [0.72-0.93] for Mini-Cog and 1 for CIB). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative cognitive screening is feasible in most geriatric elective 
      surgical patients and reveals a substantial prevalence of probable cognitive 
      impairment in this population.

TI  - Validation of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head-and-Neck-Filipino (MDASI-HN-F): 
      clinical utility of symptom screening among patients with head-and-neck cancer.
PG  - 140-149
LID - 10.1136/bmjspcare-2014-000787 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Symptom burden and quality of life (QOL) are of particular importance in 
      head-and-neck cancer treatment. The MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Head-and-Neck 
      (MDASI-HN) is a simple symptom assessment tool practicable for patient follow-up, 
      but a validated Filipino translation was previously unavailable. OBJECTIVES: The 
      objectives of this study were to develop a valid Filipino translation of the 
      MDASI-HN, to test the sensitivity of the validated MDASI core-F, and to report the 
      prevalence and pattern of head-and-neck symptoms in our cohort. METHODS: An 
      MDASI-HN-Filipino (MDASI-HN-F) version was developed and examined for convergent 
      validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, known-group validity and 
      sensitivity to change. Eligible participants were aged 18-80 years, with 
      histopathologically-proven head-and-neck (except thyroid) cancer, able to understand 
      and read English and Filipino, and without cognitive impairment or other conditions 
      precluding self-administration of the questionnaire. RESULTS: Participants (n=100) 
      were aged 18-76 years; the majority were aged <60, male, married, had college 
      schooling, or were from a Tagalog-speaking region. The validity of the MDASI HN-F 
      was demonstrated in all parameters. Age or educational attainment did not affect 
      convergent validity or test-retest reliability. At baseline, 48% had multiple 
      moderate/severe symptoms and 38% had at least one severe symptom. CONCLUSIONS: The 
      MDASI-HN-F is valid, reliable and sensitive. The sensitivity of the MDASI core-F is 
      demonstrated, and its validity and reliability reaffirmed. Moderate and severe 
      head-and-neck symptoms are prevalent in early-stage and advanced-stage head-and-neck 
      cancers, reflecting the utility of symptom screening for improvement of symptom 
      management, QOL and compliance to treatment.

PG  - 309-16
LID - 10.1002/jts.22110 [doi]
AB  - This study examined the unique and combined relationship between mild traumatic 
      brain injury (mTBI) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with psychosocial 
      functioning in a cohort of 1,312 U.S. male and female veterans of Operations 
      Enduring Freedom (OEF) and Iraqi Freedom (OIF) enrolled in the Veterans 
      After-Discharge Longitudinal Registry (Project VALOR). We assessed mTBI with 
      structured screening questions reflective of current TBI classification standards 
      and PTSD via the SCID-IV PTSD module; all other variables were assessed by 
      self-report questionnaires. We identified significant diagnostic group differences 
      in psychosocial functioning for both sexes. Individuals with PTSD, with or without a 
      history of mTBI, reported significantly worse psychosocial functioning than 
      individuals with mTBI alone or neither mTBI nor PTSD (males, η(2) p = .11, p < .001; 
      females, η(2) p = .14, p < .001), even after adjusting for demographics and severity 
      of chronic pain. The results suggested that veterans experiencing PTSD, regardless 
      of whether they had a history of mTBI, were at increased risk for long-term 
      psychosocial impairment. Further research examining possible benefits from improved 
      access to resources and treatment to address these needs would be valuable.

TI  - Walking speed is associated with self-perceived hearing handicap in high-functioning 
      older adults: The Fujiwara-kyo study.
PG  - 745-54
LID - 10.1111/ggi.12344 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The present study investigated whether physical performance and musculoskeletal 
      pain (MSP) are associated with self-perceived hearing handicap (HH) among 
      high-functioning older adults. METHODS: We analyzed a total of 3982 
      community-dwelling high-functioning older adults (age 65 years and older). HH was 
      assessed using the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Elderly-Screening. Self-reported 
      hearing impairment (HI) was evaluated using a single question. We measured handgrip 
      strength, walking speed (WS) and standing balance for assessments of physical 
      performance. The severity of MSP assessed by interviews took into account its 
      duration, limitation of daily activity and frequency. RESULTS: The prevalence of HH 
      and HI in our sample was 22.2% and 28.1%, respectively. After adjusting for other 
      two physical performance measures, MSP, sex, age, education, marital status, risk 
      factors for hearing loss, instrumental activity of daily living, depression, 
      cognitive function and self-reported HI, the odds ratios for HH in the second 
      fastest, the second slowest, and the slowest WS quartile were 1.14 (95% 
      CI = 0.81-1.58), 1.29 (95% CI = 0.92-1.79), and 1.58 (95% CI = 1.11-2.23), 
      respectively, compared with the fastest WS quartile. A significant dose-response 
      relationship was found between slower WS and HH (P for trend = 0.01). No significant 
      association with HH was found in handgrip strength, standing balance and MSP. 
      CONCLUSION: WS is associated with self-perceived HH in high-functioning older 
      adults. The present study suggests that exercise programs to improve walking ability 
      might be effective in preventing HH of self-sustainable older adults.

      Iraqi Freedom: the role of coping strategies, resilience, and social support.
PG  - 720-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic studies have found an increased risk of suicide 
      among Veterans of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom (OEF-OIF) with 
      psychiatric disorders. However, little is known about whether variables other than 
      psychiatric conditions, such as coping strategies, resilience, and social support, 
      may be related to suicidality in this population. METHODS: A total of 167 OEF-OIF 
      Veterans seeking behavioral or primary care services completed a survey containing 
      measures of combat exposure, psychopathology, pain, psychological resilience, social 
      support, and cognitive coping strategies. RESULTS: Thirty-six respondents (21.6%) 
      reported contemplating suicide in the two weeks prior to completing the survey. 
      Compared to suicide non-contemplators, suicide contemplators were older, and more 
      likely to screen positive for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
      and to report a deployment-related pain condition or complaint. They also scored 
      higher on measures of worry, self-punishment, and cognitive-behavioral avoidance 
      strategies, and lower on measures of psychological resilience and postdeployment 
      social support. Multivariate analysis revealed that a positive depression screen, 
      and higher scores on measures of self-punishment and cognitive-social avoidance 
      coping were positively associated with suicidal ideation, while higher scores on 
      measures of psychological resilience (i.e., positive acceptance of change) were 
      negatively related to suicidal ideation. Moderator analysis revealed that a positive 
      screen for depression or PTSD significantly diminished the protective effect of 
      postdeployment social support on suicidal ideation. CONCLUSIONS: 1 in 5 
      treatment-seeking OEF-OIF Veterans may contemplate suicide. Interventions to reduce 
      depressive symptoms, and maladaptive cognitive-behavioral coping strategies of 
      self-punishment and cognitive social avoidance, and to bolster psychological 
      resilience may help mitigate suicidality in this population.

TI  - The impact of spinal cord stimulation on physical function and sleep quality in 
      individuals with failed back surgery syndrome: a systematic review.
PG  - 793-802
LID - 10.1002/j.1532-2149.2011.00092.x [doi]
AB  - The aim of this review was to determine the impact of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) 
      on physical function and sleep quality in individuals with failed back surgery 
      syndrome (FBSS). This review comprised three phases: an electronic database search 
      (PubMed, Cinahl Plus, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Pedro, Cochrane Library) identified 
      potential papers; these were screened for inclusion criteria, with extraction of 
      data from accepted papers and rating of internal validity by two independent 
      reviewers using the Effective Public Health Practice Project quality assessment 
      tool, a tool designed to assess non-RCTs (randomized controlled trials) as well as 
      RCTs. Strength of the evidence was rated using the Agency for Health Care Policy and 
      Research guidelines. The search generated 13 quantitative papers that fulfilled the 
      inclusion criteria; all 13 studies investigated the impact of SCS on physical 
      function, and nine studies investigated the impact of SCS on sleep quality. 
      Consistent evidence (level C) found that SCS positively affected physical function, 
      with improvements in participation in activities of daily living, leisure, social 
      and work-related activities. Similarly, consistent evidence (level C) found 
      improvements in sleep quality following SCS. Improvements in sleep quantity, a 
      reduction in awakenings and a decrease in sleep medication use were also noted 
      (level D). The impact of SCS on cognitive function, i.e., memory and concentration, 
      was also assessed using the same search strategy, no papers fulfilled the inclusion 
      criteria for this study. Spinal cord stimulation effectively addressed many physical 
      function and sleep problems associated with FBSS; however, there is a need for 
      further high-quality objective investigations to support this.

TI  - Endocannabinoid System as Therapeutic Target of PTSD: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/life11030214 [doi]
LID - 214
AB  - Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a complex disorder involving dysregulation 
      of stress-related hormones and neurotransmitter systems. Research focused on the 
      endocannabinoid system (eCBS) for anxiety and stress regulation, cognitive and 
      emotional responses modulation and aversive memories extinction, leading to the 
      hypothesis that it could represent a possible alternative treatment target for PTSD. 
      In this systematic review, we summarize evidence about the efficacy and safety of 
      medicinal cannabidiol (CBD), Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), and nabilone in 
      PTSD treatment. The PRISMA statement guidelines were followed. A systematic 
      literature search was conducted in MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science by two 
      independent researchers, who also performed data extraction and quality assessment. 
      Among the initial 495 papers, 234 were screened for eligibility and 10 were 
      included. Studies suggested that different medicinal cannabinoids at distinct doses 
      and formulations could represent promising treatment strategies for the improvement 
      of overall PTSD symptomatology as well as specific symptom domains (e.g., sleep 
      disorders, arousal disturbances, suicidal thoughts), also influencing quality of 
      life, pain and social impact. Although there is a robust rationale for treatment 
      with drugs that target the eCBS and the results are promising, further studies are 
      needed to investigate the safety and efficacy profile of their prolonged use.

TI  - Perceived enactment of autonomy of nursing home residents: A German cross-sectional 
      study.
PG  - 186-93
LID - 10.1111/nhs.12016 [doi]
AB  - Recognizing the ageing of populations and expected increase in prevalence of 
      dementia, the necessity of research involving persons with dementia is widely agreed 
      upon. Autonomy is key to nursing home residents' well-being and quality of life, but 
      this phenomenon has not been thoroughly assessed from the residents' perspective. 
      The aim of this cross-sectional study was to investigate perceived autonomy of 
      nursing home residents. Data on 560 randomly selected residents in 40 nursing homes 
      in two German federal states were generated by face-to-face interviews, 
      psychological and physical assessments, analysis of nursing records, and acquisition 
      of institutional parameters. This paper reports on a subsample (n = 179) that met 
      screening requirements, including subjects with and without mild cognitive 
      impairment (Mini Mental Status Examination score 30-18), who completed the Hertz 
      Perceived Enactment of Autonomy Scale (HPEAS). The mean score of HPEAS was 
      101.1 ± 14.5 (range 54-122). In our population, Cronbach's alpha was 0.89. Scores in 
      HPEAS were not related to demographical factors but positively associated with 
      increasing self-efficacy and absence of pain. The novel findings contribute to an 
      understanding of autonomy from the residents' perspective.

TI  - The effect of being imitated on empathy for pain in adults with high-functioning 
      autism: Disturbed self-other distinction leads to altered empathic responding.
PG  - 712-727
LID - 10.1177/1362361317701268 [doi]
AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is associated with 
      problems in empathy. Recent research suggests that impaired control over self-other 
      overlap based on motor representations in individuals with autism spectrum disorder 
      might underlie these difficulties. In order to investigate the relationship of 
      self-other distinction and empathy for pain in high-functioning autism and matched 
      controls, we manipulated self-other distinction by using a paradigm in which 
      participants are either imitated or not by a hand on a computer screen. A strong 
      pain stimulus is then inflicted on the observed hand. Behavioral and physiological 
      results in this study showed that overall affective responses while watching pain 
      movies were the same in adults with high-functioning autism as in controls. 
      Furthermore, controls showed higher affective responding after being imitated during 
      the whole experiment, replicating previous studies. Adults with high-functioning 
      autism, however, showed increased empathic responses over time after being imitated. 
      Further exploratory analyses suggested that while affective responding was initially 
      lower after being imitated compared to not being imitated, affective responding in 
      the latter part of the experiment was higher after being imitated. These results 
      shed new light on empathic abilities in high-functioning autism and on the role of 
      control over self-other representational sharing.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantitative assessment of postsurgical knee motion provides sensitive 
      measurements, but results are technical and may not be meaningful to patients. 
      Although several knee-specific instruments exist, no patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
      measure correlates function with improved stability, motion, satisfaction, and 
      confidence. OBJECTIVE: To address both the above limitations by developing a PRO 
      measure to assess the phenomenon of a "normal" knee after primary total knee 
      arthroplasty (TKA). METHODS: A draft conceptual model linking the impact of clinical 
      mechanics to hypothesized functional outcomes was generated after a literature 
      review of available assessment tools. Participants aged 18 to 80 years having 
      undergone TKA within the past 10 to 18 months were identified and screened by 
      clinical sites to participate in phase 1 focus groups or phase 2 in-depth 
      interviews. Participants were asked to describe their TKA experiences, including how 
      their knee feels now, followed by cognitive debriefing of Patient's Knee Implant 
      Performance (PKIP) draft items. RESULTS: Phase 1 results indicated that concepts of 
      confidence, stability, and satisfaction in patients' replacement knee when 
      performing certain activities were distinct and important in the patients' 
      assessment of their TKA. Phase 2 efforts yielded a final version of the PKIP measure 
      containing nine items assessing the broader concepts of stability, confidence, and 
      satisfaction in association with activities. Presurgical and postsurgical versions 
      of the measure were created. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this qualitative study support 
      use of the PKIP as a complementary PRO measure to assess performance after primary 
      TKA. Psychometric evaluation of the PKIP is planned.

AB  - Adults with panic disorder (PD) often present to medical settings with noncardiac 
      chest pain (NCCP), but less is known about children and adolescents with this 
      complaint. We sought to characterize PD in youth with NCCP and compare features with 
      PD in youth in psychiatric outpatient settings. Using a semi-structured diagnostic 
      interview we evaluated 132 youth (ages 8-17) with NCCP recruited from two medical 
      settings. Twenty-seven (20.5 %) met full DSM-IV criteria for PD, eleven of which 
      were children (<13 years). Most frequent panic symptoms were somatic complaints, 
      although cognitive symptoms were also common. Only 14.8 % had clinically significant 
      agoraphobia. Comorbid anxiety disorders and major depression were common. Overall, 
      clinical features of PD among youth with NCCP are similar to PD in psychiatric 
      settings. Interventions for PD may benefit youth who present initially with NCCP. 
      Systematic psychiatric screening could increase detection of PD and improve care for 
      this population.

TI  - Geriatrics fellowship training and the role of geriatricians in older adult cancer 
      care: A survey of geriatrics fellowship directors.
PG  - 170-182
LID - 10.1080/02701960.2016.1247070 [doi]
AB  - The number of older adults with cancer is growing, necessitating more collaborative 
      training in geriatric principles and cancer care. The authors administered a 
      web-based survey to U.S. geriatrics program directors (PDs) addressing 
      cancer-specific training and perspectives on optimal training content and roles for 
      geriatricians in cancer care. Of 140 PDs contacted, 67 (48%) responded. Topics 
      considered very important in training included cancer screening (79%) and 
      cancer-related pain management (70%). Respondents strongly agreed that some of the 
      geriatrician's roles in cancer care included assessing functional status (64%) and 
      assessing physical/cognitive function for goals of care (64%). About one half (54%) 
      agreed that having a standardized geriatric oncology curriculum overall was 
      important. The presence of a geriatric oncologist, requiring cancer-based rotations, 
      being affiliated with a cancer center, or being internal versus family 
      medicine-based did not affect this response. Despite this high level of support, 
      cancer-related skills and knowledge warrant better definition and integration into 
      current geriatrics training. This survey establishes potential areas for future 
      educational collaborations between geriatrics and oncology training programs.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in families of young 
      children with complex congenital heart disease (CHD), and identify the demographic, 
      clinical, and psychosocial factors that place these children and their mothers at 
      greater risk of vulnerability. STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study took place 
      from June 2015 to October 2016 at The Sydney Children's Hospitals Network Cardiac 
      Service, Australia. Mothers of a child aged 1-5 years with either single ventricle 
      CHD or CHD requiring neonatal biventricular repair were invited to participate. 
      Eighty-seven mothers completed a suite of validated measures, including the 
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, which assessed the outcomes of child and 
      maternal HRQOL. RESULTS: Sixty percent of children with single ventricle CHD and 25% 
      of children with biventricular repair had total Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory 
      scores within the at-risk range. Lower child HRQOL was strongly associated with 
      single ventricle CHD (β = -0.38; P < .001), physical comorbidity (β = -0.32; 
      P = .001), feeding difficulties (β = -0.26; P = .008), and greater maternal 
      psychological stress (β = -0.18; P = .045), accounting for 52% of the variance in 
      child HRQOL. Lower maternal HRQOL was strongly associated with poorer family 
      functioning (β = 0.61; P < .001), greater maternal psychological stress (β = -0.23; 
      P = .004), child physical comorbidity (β = -0.17; P = .01), and a 'difficult' child 
      temperament (β = -0.14; P = .01), accounting for 73% of the variance in maternal 
      HRQOL. CONCLUSIONS: Lower HRQOL is common in young children with complex CHD, 
      particularly single ventricle CHD. Several predictors of HRQOL are potentially 
      modifiable, offering possible pathways for prevention and early intervention. 
      Routine screening is a necessary first step toward developing models of care to 
      improve HRQOL in this population.

TI  - Can an observational pain assessment tool improve time to analgesia for cognitively 
      impaired older persons? A cluster randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 33-38
LID - 10.1136/emermed-2016-206065 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The primary objective of the study was to measure the impact of an 
      observational pain assessment dementia tool on time from ED arrival to first dose of 
      analgesic medicine. METHODS: A multisite cluster randomised controlled trial was 
      conducted to test the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia (PAINAD) tool. Patients 
      aged 65 years or older suspected of a long bone fracture were screened for cognitive 
      impairment using the Six-Item Screening (SIS) tool. Patients scoring 4 or less on 
      SIS (intervention sites) were assessed for pain using PAINAD. Control sites, 
      assessed pain using standard methods. The primary outcome was time to first dose of 
      analgesia and was analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with a sensitivity 
      analysis. RESULTS: We enrolled 602 patients, of which 323 (54%) were at intervention 
      sites (n=4). The median time to analgesia was 82 min (IQR 45-151 min). There was no 
      statistically significant difference in median time to analgesia for intervention 83 
      (IQR 48-158 min) and non-intervention 82 min (IQR 41-147 min) sites (p=0.414). After 
      adjusting for age, fracture type, arrival mode and triage category, there remained 
      no significant difference in time to analgesia (HR 0.97, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.17, 
      p=0.74). Of the 602 patients enrolled, 273 actually had cognitive impairment. A 
      sensitivity analysis demonstrated patients at intervention sites received analgesia 
      13 min sooner (90 vs 103 min, p=0.91). CONCLUSION: Use of the PAINAD was not 
      associated with a shorter time to analgesia, although there was a clinically 
      important but non-significant improvement in the cognitively impaired patient group. 
      Further research is needed to address this clinically important and complex issue.

TI  - Establishing a proactive geriatrician led comprehensive geriatric assessment in 
      older emergency surgery patients: Outcomes of a pilot study.
PG  - e13096
LID - 10.1111/ijcp.13096 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Increasing numbers of older adults are presenting with acute surgical 
      disease to the unselected general surgical take. General surgeons have little 
      training to manage these patients. We developed a pilot service of proactive 
      geriatrician input into older emergency general surgical patients in a single 
      institution. We wanted to demonstrate if geriatricians improve the management of 
      these patients. METHODS: Patients aged 70 years or older admitted acutely under the 
      general surgeons were assessed proactively by a geriatrician using comprehensive 
      geriatric assessment (CGA). Data were collected prospectively using a data 
      collection form of any new issues detected and interventions made by the 
      geriatricians in addition to the surgical plan. This information was entered into an 
      excel database and analysed. RESULTS: We obtained data for 447 patients between 
      November 2016 and July 2017. CGA led to additional diagnoses or interventions in 83% 
      of patients. The most common problems identified included a new medical diagnosis 
      (35.2%), polypharmacy (30%), recent falls (19.7%), weight loss (17.2%) and 
      uncontrolled pain (16.7%). Abbreviated mental tests were performed in 87.5% 
      patients, with 22% being detected with cognitive impairment. Frailty screening was 
      performed in 97% of patients resulting in 38% being identified as frail. New 
      interventions included stopping medications (40%), starting medications (28%) and 
      referral to multidisciplinary teams (70.1%). Length of stay was reduced by 
      0.55 days. CONCLUSION: Proactive geriatrician input identifies medical diagnoses and 
      geriatric syndromes missed by the surgical teams. Managing these issues has 
      contributed to a reduced length of stay in these patients.

AB  - Phenotyping with traditional behavioral assays constitutes a major bottleneck in the 
      primary screening, characterization, and validation of genetic mouse models of 
      disease, leading to downstream delays in drug discovery efforts. We present a novel 
      and comprehensive one-stop approach to phenotyping, the PhenoCube™. This system 
      simultaneously captures the cognitive performance, motor activity, and circadian 
      patterns of group-housed mice by use of home-cage operant conditioning modules 
      (IntelliCage) and custom-built computer vision software. We evaluated two different 
      mouse models of Huntington's Disease (HD), the R6/2 and the BACHD in the PhenoCube™ 
      system. Our results demonstrated that this system can efficiently capture and track 
      alterations in both cognitive performance and locomotor activity patterns associated 
      with these disease models. This work extends our prior demonstration that PhenoCube™ 
      can characterize circadian dysfunction in BACHD mice and shows that this system, 
      with the experimental protocols used, is a sensitive and efficient tool for a first 
      pass high-throughput screening of mouse disease models in general and mouse models 
      of neurodegeneration in particular.

TI  - Emergency department-initiated palliative care for advanced cancer patients: 
      protocol for a pilot randomized controlled trial.
PG  - 251
LID - 10.1186/1745-6215-15-251 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: For patients with advanced cancer, visits to the emergency department 
      (ED) are common. Such patients present to the ED with a specific profile of 
      palliative care needs, including burdensome symptoms such as pain, dyspnea, or 
      vomiting that cannot be controlled in other settings and a lack of well-defined 
      goals of care. The goals of this study are: i) to test the feasibility of 
      recruiting, enrolling, and randomizing patients with serious illness in the ED; and 
      ii) to evaluate the impact of ED-initiated palliative care on health care 
      utilization, quality of life, and survival. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a protocol for a 
      single center parallel, two-arm randomized controlled trial in ED patients with 
      metastatic solid tumors comparing ED-initiated palliative care referral to a control 
      group receiving usual care. We plan to enroll 125 to 150 ED-advanced cancer patients 
      at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, USA, who meet the following criteria: i) pass a 
      brief cognitive screen; ii) speak fluent English or Spanish; and iii) have never 
      been seen by palliative care. We will use balanced block randomization in groups of 
      50 to assign patients to the intervention or control group after completion of a 
      baseline questionnaire. All research staff performing assessment or analysis will be 
      blinded to patient assignment. We will measure the impact of the palliative care 
      intervention on the following outcomes: i) timing and rate of palliative care 
      consultation; ii) quality of life and depression at 12 weeks, measured using the 
      FACT-G and PHQ-9; iii) health care utilization; and iv) length of survival. The 
      primary analysis will be based on intention-to-treat. DISCUSSION: This pilot 
      randomized controlled trial will test the feasibility of recruiting, enrolling, and 
      randomizing patients with advanced cancer in the ED, and provide a preliminary 
      estimate of the impact of palliative care referral on health care utilization, 
      quality of life, and survival. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials.gov identifier:

AB  - PURPOSE: The Neurobics Trial is a single-blind, parallel-group, randomized, 
      controlled trial. The main study objective is to compare effectiveness of 
      preoperative cognitive exercise versus no intervention for lowering the incidence of 
      postoperative delirium. Enrollment began March 2015 and is ongoing. METHODS: 
      Eligible participants include patients older than 60 years of age scheduled for 
      nonemergent, noncardiac, nonneurological surgery at our institution. Patients 
      provide consent and are screened at our Outpatient Preoperative Assessment Clinic to 
      rule out preexisting cognitive dysfunction, significant mental health disorders, and 
      history of surgery requiring general anesthesia in the preceding 6 months. 
      Participants meeting criteria are randomized to complete 1 hour daily of electronic 
      tablet-based cognitive exercise for 10 days before surgery or no preoperative 
      intervention. Compliance with the effective dose of 10 total hours of preoperative 
      exercise is verified on return of the patient for surgery with time logs created by 
      the software application and by patient self-reporting. After surgery, patients are 
      evaluated for delirium in the postanesthesia recovery area, and then twice daily for 
      the remainder of their hospitalization. Additionally, postoperative quality of 
      recovery is assessed daily, along with pain scores and opiate use. More 
      comprehensive cognitive assessments are completed just before discharge for baseline 
      comparison, and quality of recovery is assessed via telephone interview 7, 30, and 
      90 days post-surgery. The primary outcome is the incidence of delirium during the 
      postoperative hospitalization period. Randomization is computer generated, with 
      allocation concealment in opaque envelopes. All postoperative assessments are 
      completed by blinded study personnel. FINDINGS: The study is actively recruiting 
      with 19 patients having provided consent to date, and a total of 264 patients is 
      required for study completion; therefore, no data analysis is currently under way 
      (www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT02230605). IMPLICATIONS: To our knowledge, the Neurobics 
      Trial is the first randomized, controlled study to investigate the effectiveness of 
      a significant preoperative cognitive exercise regimen for the prevention of delirium 
      after noncardiac, nonneurological surgery in elderly patients.

TI  - Introduction of virtual patients onto a final year anesthesia course: Hong Kong 
      experience.
PG  - 71-83
LID - 10.2147/AMEP.S13037 [doi]
AB  - e-Learning has revolutionized the way in which undergraduate medical education is 
      delivered. One e-learning tool of note is the virtual patient (VP), a type of 
      computer software that simulates real-life clinical scenarios, in which the learner 
      emulates the role of health care provider to obtain the history, conduct 
      examination, and make diagnoses and management decisions. VPs have been in use since 
      1993. Early designs were based on serial screen-cards of patient history, 
      examination, investigations, diagnoses, treatment, and outcome, which the learner 
      explored. With the development of web technology, VPs can now be accessed via the 
      Internet and are more versatile, supporting different structural designs to suit a 
      variety of learning objectives, and they can branch via different routes through a 
      case. Using VPs has a number of advantages: 1) VPs improve access to learning 
      material, 2) VPs help learners to acquire higher order cognitive skills like 
      strategic thinking and decision making, 3) VPs provide a safe environment to 
      practice, 4) VPs help to teach interdisciplinary care, and 5) VPs can be used 
      instead of patients for examination. A number of well-known VP player systems are in 
      use today: CASUS, CAMPUS, web-based Simulation of Patients, OpenLabyrinth, and 
      vpSim. At the Chinese University of Hong Kong, we have also developed a web-based VP 
      authoring and player system called Formative Assessment Case Studies (FACS), which 
      is run by our Teaching and Learning Resources Centre. FACS has been integrated into 
      Year-5 Anesthesia teaching since 2006. Three VP products have been developed: 
      Anaesthesia FACS (six cases) that teaches preoperative assessment, Acute Pain 
      Management FACS, and an eight-part longitudinal VP which tells the story of a 
      patient's stay, and anesthesia care, for routine gynecological surgery. Students 
      spend about 3 hours on each during a 2-week clinical attachment. Our VPs have been 
      well received and have overcome problems of providing adequate clinical exposure.

AB  - Migraine ranks as the third most common disease in the world and has caused 
      significant losses of daily life abilities. Previously, people gave more attention 
      to the pain of migraines and usually ignored the impairments of cognitive function 
      in migraineurs. In the present study, a duration discrimination paradigm was used to 
      assess the global and local biological motion perception in migraineurs and healthy 
      controls. In the experiment, biological motion sequences and inanimate motion 
      sequences (the inverted biological motion sequences) were sequentially presented on 
      a screen. Observers were instructed to make a two-alternative forced choice to 
      accurately indicate which interval (the first or the second) appeared longer. The 
      stimuli involved global biological motion sequences and local biological motion 
      sequences. The statistical analyses were conducted on the points of subjective 
      equality that were obtained by fitting a psychometric function to each individual 
      observer's data. In migraineurs, global biological motion signals lengthened the 
      perceived temporal duration (as occurs in normal people), whereas local biological 
      motion signals did not have this temporal dilation effect. The results indicated 
      that patients with migraine showed a deficit in local biological motion perception, 
      whereas their global biological motion perception was comparable to that of healthy 
      subjects.

AB  - Chronic pain in Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is probably related to maladaptive 
      plasticity of brain areas involved in nociceptive processing. Transcranial Direct 
      Current Stimulation (tDCS) and Peripheral Electrical Stimulation (PES) can modulate 
      cortical excitability and help to control chronic pain. Studies have shown that 
      combined use of tDCS and PES has additive effects. However, to date, no study 
      investigated additive effects of these neuromodulatory techniques on chronic pain in 
      patients with SCD. This protocol describes a study aiming to assess whether combined 
      use of tDCS and PES more effectively alleviate pain in patients with SCD compared to 
      single use of each technique. The study consists of a one-session double blind, 
      block-randomized clinical trial (NCT02813629) in which 128 participants with SCD and 
      femoral osteonecrosis will be enrolled. Stepwise procedures will occur on two 
      independent days. On day 1, participants will be screened for eligibility criteria. 
      On day 2, data collection will occur in four stages: sample characterization, 
      baseline assessment, intervention, and post-intervention assessment. These 
      procedures will last ~5 h. Participants will be divided into two groups according to 
      homozygous for S allele (HbSS) (n = 64) and heterozygous for S and C alleles (HbSC) 
      (n = 64) genotypes. Participants in each group will be randomly assigned, equally, 
      to one of the following interventions: (1) active tDCS + active PES; (2) active tDCS 
      + sham PES; (3) sham tDCS + active PES; and (4) sham tDCS + sham PES. Active tDCS 
      intervention will consist of 20 min 2 mA anodic stimulation over the primary motor 
      cortex contralateral to the most painful hip. Active PES intervention will consist 
      of 30 min sensory electrical stimulation at 100 Hz over the most painful hip. The 
      main study outcome will be pain intensity, measured by a Visual Analogue Scale. In 
      addition, electroencephalographic power density, cortical maps of the gluteus 
      maximus muscle elicited by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), serum levels of 
      Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), and Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) will be 
      assessed as secondary outcomes. Data will be analyzed using ANOVA of repeated 
      measures, controlling for confounding variables.

TI  - Diagnoses, problems and healthcare interventions amongst older people with an 
      unscheduled hospital admission who have concurrent mental health problems: a 
      prevalence study.
PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/1471-2318-14-43 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frail older people with mental health problems including delirium, 
      dementia and depression are often admitted to general hospitals. However, hospital 
      admission may cause distress, and can be associated with complications. Some 
      commentators suggest that their healthcare needs could be better met elsewhere. 
      METHODS: We studied consecutive patients aged 70 or older admitted for emergency 
      medical or trauma care to an 1800 bed general hospital which provided sole emergency 
      medical and trauma services for its local population. Patients were screened for 
      mental health problems, and those screening positive were invited to take part. 250 
      participants were recruited and a sub-sample of 53 patients was assessed by a 
      geriatrician for diagnoses, impairments and disabilities, healthcare interventions 
      and outstanding needs. RESULTS: Median age was 86 years, median Mini-Mental State 
      Examination score at admission was 16/30, and 45% had delirium. 19% lived in a care 
      home prior to admission. All the patients were complex. A wide range of main 
      admission diagnoses was recorded, and these were usually complicated by falls, 
      immobility, pain, delirium, dehydration or incontinence. There was a median of six 
      active diagnoses, and eight active problems. One quarter of problems was 
      unexplained. A median of 13 interventions was recorded, and a median of a further 
      four interventions suggested by the geriatrician. Those with more severe cognitive 
      impairment had no less medical need. CONCLUSIONS: This patient group, admitted to 
      hospital in the United Kingdom, had numerous healthcare problems, and by 
      implication, extensive healthcare needs. Patients with simpler conditions were not 
      identified, but may have already been rapidly discharged or redirected to 
      non-hospital services by the time assessments were made. To meet the needs of this 
      group outside the hospital would need considerable investment in medical, nursing, 
      therapy and diagnostic facilities. In the meantime, acute hospitals should adapt to 
      deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment, and provide for their mental health 
      needs.

TI  - Methodology and baseline characteristics for the Sarcopenia and Hip Fracture study: 
      a 5-year prospective study.
PG  - 568-74
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glp002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Age-related hip fractures are associated with poor functional outcomes, 
      resulting in substantial personal and societal burden. There is a need to better 
      identify reversible etiologic predictors of suboptimal functional recovery in this 
      group. METHODS: The Sarcopenia and Hip Fracture (SHIP) study was a 5-year 
      prospective cohort study following community-dwelling older persons admitted to 
      three Sydney hospitals for hip fracture. Information was collected at baseline, and 
      4 and 12 months, including health status, quality of life, nutritional status, body 
      composition, muscle strength, range of motion, gait velocity, balance, walking 
      endurance, disability, cognition, depression, fear of falling, self-efficacy, social 
      support, physical activity level, vision, and fall-related data, with residential 
      status, disability, and mortality reassessed at 5 years. RESULTS: 193 participants 
      enrolled (81 +/- 8 years, 72% women). High levels of activities of daily living, 
      disability and sedentariness were present prior to fracture. At admission, the 
      cohort had high levels of chronic disease; 38% were depressed, 38% were cognitively 
      impaired, and 26% had heart disease. Seventy-one percent of participants were 
      sarcopenic, 58% undernourished, and 55% vitamin D deficient. Mobility, strength, and 
      vision were severely impaired. There was little evidence that these comorbidities 
      were either recognized or treated during hospitalization. Disability, sedentariness, 
      malnutrition, and walking endurance predicted acute hospitalization length of stay. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The complex comorbidity, pre-existing functional impairment, and 
      sedentary behavior in patients with hip fracture suggest the need for thorough 
      screening and targeting of potentially reversible impairments. Rehabilitation 
      outcomes are likely to be highly dependent on amelioration of these highly prevalent 
      accompaniments to hip fracture.

TI  - How Accurately Do Consecutive Cohort Audits Predict Phase III Multisite Clinical 
      Trial Recruitment in Palliative Care?

AB  - CONTEXT: Audits have been proposed for estimating possible recruitment rates to 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs), but few studies have compared audit data with 
      subsequent recruitment rates. OBJECTIVES: To compare the accuracy of estimates of 
      potential recruitment from a retrospective consecutive cohort audit of actual 
      participating sites and recruitment to four Phase III multisite clinical RCTs. 
      METHODS: The proportion of potentially eligible study participants estimated from an 
      inpatient chart review of people with life-limiting illnesses referred to six 
      Australian specialist palliative care services was compared with recruitment data 
      extracted from study prescreening information from three sites that participated 
      fully in four Palliative Care Clinical Studies Collaborative RCTs. The predominant 
      reasons for ineligibility in the audit and RCTs were analyzed. RESULTS: The audit 
      overestimated the proportion of people referred to the palliative care services who 
      could participate in the RCTs (pain 17.7% vs. 1.2%, delirium 5.8% vs. 0.6%, anorexia 
      5.1% vs. 0.8%, and bowel obstruction 2.8% vs. 0.5%). Approximately 2% of the 
      referral base was potentially eligible for these effectiveness studies. 
      Ineligibility for general criteria (language, cognition, and geographic proximity) 
      varied between studies, whereas the reasons for exclusion were similar between the 
      audit and pain and anorexia studies but not for delirium or bowel obstruction. 
      CONCLUSION: The retrospective consecutive case note audit in participating sites did 
      not predict realistic recruitment rates, mostly underestimating the impact of 
      study-specific inclusion criteria. These findings have implications for the 
      applicability of the results of RCTs. Prospective pilot studies are more likely to 
      predict actual recruitment.

TI  - Minimally invasive anterior muscle-sparing versus a transgluteal approach for 
      hemiarthroplasty in femoral neck fractures-a prospective randomised controlled trial 
      including 190 elderly patients.
PG  - 222

AB  - BACKGROUND: The relevance of femoral neck fractures (FNFs) increases with the ageing 
      of numerous societies, injury-related decline is observed in many patients. 
      Treatment strategies have evolved towards primary joint replacement, but the impact 
      of different approaches remains a matter of debate. The aim of this trial was to 
      evaluate the benefit of an anterior minimally-invasive (AMIS) compared to a lateral 
      Hardinge (LAT) approach for hemiarthroplasty in these oftentimes frail patients. 
      METHODS: Four hundred thirty-nine patients were screened during the 44-months trial, 
      aiming at the evaluation of 150 patients > 60 yrs. of age. Eligible patients were 
      randomised using an online-tool with completely random assignment. As primary 
      endpoint, early mobility, a predictor for long-term outcomes, was evaluated at 
      3 weeks via the "Timed up and go" test (TUG). Secondary endpoints included the 
      Functional Independence Measure (FIM), pain, complications, one-year mobility and 
      mortality. RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were randomised; both groups were 
      comparable at baseline, with a predominance for frailty-associated factors in the 
      AMIS-group. At 3 weeks, 146 patients were assessed for the primary outcome. There 
      was a reduction in the median duration of TUG performance of 21.5% (CI [- 41.2,4.7], 
      p = 0.104) in the AMIS-arm (i.e., improved mobility). This reduction was more 
      pronounced in patients with signs of frailty or cognitive impairment. FIM scores 
      increased on average by 6.7 points (CI [0.5-12.8], p = 0.037), pain measured on a 
      10-point visual analogue scale decreased on average by 0.7 points (CI: [- 1.4,0.0], 
      p = 0.064). The requirement for blood transfusion was lower in the AMIS- group, the 
      rate of complications comparable, with a higher rate of soft tissue complications in 
      the LAT-group. The mortality was higher in the AMIS-group. CONCLUSION: These 
      results, similar to previous reports, support the concept that in elderly patients 
      at risk of frailty, the AMIS approach for hemiarthroplasty can be beneficial, since 
      early mobilisation and pain reduction potentially reduce deconditioning, morbidity 
      and loss of independence. The results are, however, influenced by a plethora of 
      factors. Only improvements in every aspect of the therapeutic chain can lead to 
      optimisation of treatment and improve outcomes in this growing patient population.

      committee (Ethikkommission beider Basel, EKBB Reference No. 68/11). Since 2014 the 
      ethics committee incorporates several cantons under the name Ethikkommission 
      Nordweistschweiz (EKNZ). The trial followed good clinical practice (GCP) as well as 
      the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. Key personnel had appropriate training in 
      GCP. The trial has been registered with clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01408693 
      (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01408693, last accessed January 24th, 2018). 
      The complete protocol is available as additional file. Eligible patients entered the 
      informed consent process. Depending on their cognitive abilities (quantified using a 
      mental status questionnaire), they were individually, or in the presence of a 
      designated proxy, informed about the diagnosis, the proposed treatment and the 
      randomised trial. Patients were only included by the surgeon on call if they 
      consented in writing or – in the case of cognitive impairment – gave their verbal 
      assent with written consent by a designated proxy according to the Swiss civil code 
      (Art. 378) or a legal guardian. CONSENT FOR PUBLICATION: Not applicable. COMPETING

TI  - The Spanish version of the Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool: translation, validity 
      and reliability.
PG  - 2283-91

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite showing acceptable psychometric properties, the criterion 
      validity of the original Fibromyalgia Rapid Screening Tool (FiRST) has been called 
      into question for including insufficiently challenging comparison groups. 
      Consequently our objective was to validate a Spanish version of the FiRST including 
      pain disorders more analogous to fibromyalgia. METHODS: The FiRST was translated 
      following international standards. Internal consistency and temporal stability were 
      assessed. The ability of the FiRST global score as a screening tool for fibromyalgia 
      (criterion validity) was assessed by logistic regression analysis. To determine the 
      degree to which potential confounders might affect the criterion validity of the 
      FiRST (divergent validity), it was reassessed by hierarchical multivariate logistic 
      regression, entering demographics in a first step, followed by pain, anxiety and 
      depression, catastrophizing, disability and the FiRST global score in a last step. 
      RESULTS: The final sample comprised 257 patients (67% cases of fibromyalgia). The 
      Spanish version of the FiRST showed acceptable internal consistency, reliability and 
      criterion validity. The FiRST was able to discriminate between fibromyalgia and 
      non-fibromyalgia patients even after controlling for the effect of potential 
      confounders. However, both criterion and divergent validity were challenged by a 
      moderate specificity. CONCLUSION: The Spanish version of the FiRST may be used as a 
      screening tool for fibromyalgia even in those patients whose cognitive style is 
      characterized by catastrophizing about pain and high levels of functional 
      disability, anxiety and depression. The clinical consequences of the moderate 
      specificity shown by this Spanish version of the FiRST are discussed.

AB  - The experience of cognitive deficits and emotional dysfunction are prevalent in 
      people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS), although research examining their interaction 
      has provided inconsistent findings. The current study examined the ability of 
      executive function to predict psychosocial adjustment in PwMS. One hundred and seven 
      PwMS underwent cognitive assessment and completed measures of stress, depression, 
      anxiety, and quality of life (QoL). There was limited support for a relationship. 
      There was no relationship between objective cognitive tasks and state or trait 
      anxiety, mental health QoL, overall QoL, or stress frequency. The only relationship 
      with depression was found when the Beck Depression Inventory Fast-Screen was used, 
      with a task of planning when the timing element was removed. A measure of error 
      rates on a task of cognitive flexibility predicted physical health QoL, and 
      severity, but not frequency, of stress was predicted by a task of working memory. 
      The results of this study highlight the need for further research into the 
      relationship between cognitive deficits and psychosocial adjustment because of the 
      conflicting findings between studies and call for a common measurement framework for 
      future investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the validity of using social 
      media for depression screening. METHOD: Article searches on PubMed and PsycINFO from 
      database inception to August 20, 2019 were completed with a search string and 
      filters. RESULTS: 15 articles made the inclusion criteria. Facebook, Twitter, and 
      Instagram profiles of depressed people were distinguishable from nondepressed people 
      shown by social media markers. Facebook studies showed that having fewer Facebook 
      friends and mutual friends, posting frequently, and using fewer location tags 
      positively correlated with depressive symptoms. Also, Facebook posts with explicit 
      expression of depressive symptoms, use of personal pronouns, and words related to 
      pain, depressive symptoms, aggressive emotions, and rumination predicted depression. 
      Twitter studies showed that the use of "past focus" words, negative emotions and 
      anger words, and fewer words per Tweet positively correlated with depression. 
      Finally, Instagram studies showed that differences in follower patterns, photo 
      posting and editing, and linguistic features between depressed people and 
      nondepressed people could serve as a marker. LIMITATIONS: The primary articles 
      analyzed had different methods, which constricts the amount of comparisons that can 
      be made. Further, only four social media platforms were explored. CONCLUSION: Social 
      media markers like number and content of Facebook messages, linguistic variability 
      in tweets and tweet word count on Twitter, and number of followers, frequency of 
      Instagram use and the content of messages on Instagram differed between depressed 
      people and nondepressed people. Therefore, screening social media profiles on these 
      platforms could be a valid way to detect depression.

      Life, Overall Survival, and Mental Health.

AB  - CONTEXT: The associations between Type D personality and poor quality of life, 
      overall survival, and mental health in gastric cancer survivors. OBJECTIVES: The aim 
      of this research was to explore quality of life (QoL), mental health status, Type D 
      personality, symptom duration, and emergency admissions of Chinese gastric cancer 
      patients, as well as the relationship between these factors. METHODS: Eight hundred 
      thirty eligible Chinese patients newly diagnosed with gastric cancer between July 
      2009 and July 2011 were enrolled in this prospective study. Type D personality was 
      measured with the 14-item Type D Personality Scale (DS14). Mental health status was 
      measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The QoL outcomes were 
      assessed longitudinally using the European Organization for Research and Treatment 
      of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 and Quality of Life 
      Questionnaire-STO22 at baseline and six months after diagnosis. RESULTS: The 
      proportion of patients with symptom duration of more than one month and who were 
      diagnosed after emergency admissions in the Type D group was significantly higher 
      than that in the non-Type D personality group. At both of the time points, Type D 
      patients reported statistically significant lower scores on role, emotional, 
      cognitive, and social functioning (all Ps < 0.001) functional scales, global health 
      status/QoL scales (P < 0.001), and worse symptom scores compared to patients without 
      a Type D personality. During the six-month time frame, a higher percentage of 
      patients in the Type D group demonstrated a considerable QoL deterioration. 
      Clinically elevated levels of anxiety and depression were more prevalent in Type D 
      than in non-Type D survivors (both Ps < 0.001). There was a statistically 
      significant difference in three-year overall survival between the patients in the 
      Type D group and the non-Type D personality group. CONCLUSION: Type D personality is 
      associated with poor QoL, three-year overall survival and mental health status among 
      survivors of gastric cancer, even after adjustment of confounding background 
      variables. The Type D personality group experienced increased levels of pain and 
      fatigue compared to non-Type D patients. Type D personality might be a general 
      vulnerability factor to screen for subgroups at risk of longer symptom duration and 
      emergency admissions in clinical practice.

      for delirium in period of 1 year in seven palliative care services. General data, 
      including primary tumor, age, gender, concomitant disease, palliative prognostic 
      score (PaP), and Karnofsky status, were collected. Possible causes or factors 
      associated with delirium were looked for. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale was 
      used to assess physical and psychological symptoms and the Memorial Delirium 
      Assessment Scale (MDAS) to assess the cognitive status of patients, at admission 
      (T0) and 1 week after palliative care (T7). RESULTS: Of 848 patients screened, 263 
      patients were evaluated. Sixty-six patients had only the initial evaluation. The 
      mean Karnofsky status was 34.1 (SD = 6.69); the mean PaP score at admission was 6.9 
      (SD = 3.97). The mean duration of palliative care assistance, equivalent to 
      survival, was 38.4 days (SD = 48, range 2-220). The mean MDAS values at admission 
      and after 1 week of palliative care were 6.9 (SD = 6.71) and 8.8 (SD = 8.26), 
      respectively. One hundred ten patients (41.8%) and 167 patients (67.3%) had MDAS 
      values ≥ 7 at admission and after 1 week of palliative care, respectively. Age, 
      dehydration, cachexia, chemotherapy in the last three months, and intensity of 
      drowsiness and dyspnea were independently associated with a MDAS > 7. A worsening of 
      drowsiness, the use of opioids, and the use of corticosteroids were independently 
      associated with changes of MDAS from T0 to T7. CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence 
      of delirium seems to be similar to that reported in other acute settings, delirium 
      tended to worsen or poorly responded to a palliative care treatment. Some clinical 
      factors were independently associated with delirium. This information is relevant 
      for decision-making when delirium does not change despite a traditional 
      intervention. Continuous assessment of delirium should be performed in these 
      settings to detect deterioration of cognitive function. Further studies should 
      elucidate whether an earlier approach to palliative care would decrease the 
      prevalence of delirium at a late stage of disease.

AB  - CONTEXT: Symptom clusters in advanced cancer can influence patient outcomes. There 
      is large heterogeneity in the methods used to identify symptom clusters. OBJECTIVES: 
      To investigate the consistency of symptom cluster composition in advanced cancer 
      patients using different statistical methodologies for all patients across five 
      primary cancer sites, and to examine which clusters predict functional status, a 
      global assessment of health and global quality of life. METHODS: Principal component 
      analysis and exploratory factor analysis (with different rotation and factor 
      selection methods) and hierarchical cluster analysis (with different linkage and 
      similarity measures) were used on a data set of 1562 advanced cancer patients who 
      completed the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality 
      of Life Questionnaire-Core 30. RESULTS: Four clusters consistently formed for many 
      of the methods and cancer sites: tense-worry-irritable-depressed (emotional 
      cluster), fatigue-pain, nausea-vomiting, and concentration-memory (cognitive 
      cluster). The emotional cluster was a stronger predictor of overall quality of life 
      than the other clusters. Fatigue-pain was a stronger predictor of overall health 
      than the other clusters. The cognitive cluster and fatigue-pain predicted physical 
      functioning, role functioning, and social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: The four 
      identified symptom clusters were consistent across statistical methods and cancer 
      types, although there were some noteworthy differences. Statistical derivation of 
      symptom clusters is in need of greater methodological guidance. A psychosocial 
      pathway in the management of symptom clusters may improve quality of life. 
      Biological mechanisms underpinning symptom clusters need to be delineated by future 
      research. A framework for evidence-based screening, assessment, treatment, and 
      follow-up of symptom clusters in advanced cancer is essential.

TI  - Painful and non-painful diabetic neuropathy, diagnostic challenges and implications 
      for future management.
LID - awab079 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/brain/awab079 [doi]
AB  - Peripheral neuropathy is one of the most common complications of both type 1 and 
      type 2 diabetes. Up to half of patients with diabetes develop neuropathy during the 
      course of their disease, which is accompanied by neuropathic pain in to 30-40% of 
      cases. Peripheral nerve injury in diabetes can manifest as progressive distal 
      symmetric polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, radiculo-plexopathies, and 
      mononeuropathies. The most common diabetic neuropathy is distal symmetric 
      polyneuropathy, which we will refer to as DN, with its characteristic glove and 
      stocking like presentation of distal sensory or motor function loss. DN or its 
      painful counterpart, painful DN, are associated with increased mortality and 
      morbidity; thus, early recognition and preventive measures are essential. 
      Nevertheless, it is not easy to diagnose DN or painful DN, particularly in patients 
      with early and mild neuropathy, and there is currently no single established 
      diagnostic gold standard. The most common diagnostic approach in research is a 
      hierarchical system, which combines symptoms, signs, and a series of confirmatory 
      tests. The general lack of long-term prospective studies has limited the evaluation 
      of the sensitivity and specificity of new morphometric and neurophysiological 
      techniques. Thus, the best paradigm for screening DN and painful DN both in research 
      and in clinical practice remains uncertain. Herein, we review the diagnostic 
      challenges from both clinical and research perspectives and their implications for 
      managing patients with DN. There is no established DN treatment, apart from improved 
      glycemic control, which is more effective in type 1 than in type 2 diabetes, and 
      only symptomatic management is available for painful DN. Currently, less than one 
      third of painful DN patients derive sufficient pain relief with existing 
      pharmacotherapies. A more precise and distinct sensory profile from patients with DN 
      and painful DN may help identify responsive patients to one treatment versus 
      another. Detailed sensory profiles will lead to tailored treatment for patient 
      subgroups with painful DN by matching to novel or established DN pathomechanisms and 
      also for improved clinical trials stratification. Large randomized clinical trials 
      are needed to identify the interventions, i.e. pharmacological, physical, cognitive, 
      educational, etc, which leads to the best therapeutic outcomes.

TI  - Live Video Adaptations to a Mind-Body Activity Program for Chronic Pain and 
      Cognitive Decline: Protocol for the Virtual Active Brains Study.
PG  - e25351
LID - 10.2196/25351 [doi]
LID - e25351
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic pain (CP) and cognitive decline (CD) are costly, challenging to 
      treat, prevalent among older adults, and worsen each other over time. We are 
      iteratively developing Active Brains-Fitbit (AB-F), a live video program for older 
      adults with CP and CD that teaches mind-body skills and gradual increases in step 
      count. AB-F has demonstrated feasibility; acceptability; and signs of improvement in 
      emotional, physical, and cognitive functions when delivered in person to older 
      adults. OBJECTIVE: We are conducting a feasibility randomized controlled trial (RCT) 
      of AB-F versus a time- and dose-matched educational control (health enhancement 
      program [HEP]) in older adults with CP and CD. Here, we describe virtual adaptions 
      to our study protocol, manualized treatments, evaluation plan, and study design in 
      response to feedback from former participants and COVID-19. We will evaluate the 
      feasibility benchmarks and the potential of AB-F to improve physical, emotional, and 
      cognitive functions. METHODS: This is a single-blind pilot RCT. Participants are 
      randomized to AB-F or HEP. Patients are recruited through pain clinic referrals, 
      institutional registries, and flyers. Interested participants are screened for 
      eligibility via telephone and provide electronic informed consent. After 
      randomization, participants are mailed all study documents, including their 
      treatment manual, an ActiGraph accelerometer, and a Fitbit (separate envelope for 
      AB-F only). Both conditions are manualized and delivered over 8 weekly sessions via 
      Zoom. Participants complete self-report and performance-based (6-min walk test and 
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment) outcome measures via Zoom at baseline and post 
      intervention. Primary outcomes are a priori set feasibility (recruitment, 
      quantitative measures, and adherence), acceptability, credibility, expectancy, and 
      satisfaction benchmarks. Secondary outcomes are physical, cognitive, and emotional 
      functions as well as intervention targets (social function, pain intensity, 
      pain-specific coping, and mindfulness). RESULTS: The trial is ongoing. We have 
      recruited 21 participants (10 AB-F and 11 HEP) across 2 rounds. Only 2 participants 
      have withdrawn (1 before baseline and 1 before the first session). All 19 remaining 
      participants have completed the baseline assessment. In the first round, attendance 
      is high (11 out of 12 participants completed all 4 sessions so far), and AB-F 
      participants are adherent to their Fitbit and step goals (5 out of 6 participants). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings are promising for the feasibility of our 
      completely virtual AB-F intervention. However, these findings need to be confirmed 
      at the trial conclusion. This study will answer important questions about the 
      feasibility of delivering a completely virtual mind-body activity program to older 
      adults with comorbid CP and CD, which, to our knowledge, is unprecedented. Details 
      on integrating multiple digital platforms for virtual assessments and intervention 
      delivery will inform treatment development for older adults and those with comorbid 
      CP and CD, which is crucial during the COVID-19 pandemic. TRIAL REGISTRATION:

TI  - Prescription Opioids and Risk of Dementia or Cognitive Decline: A Prospective Cohort 
      Study.
PG  - 1519-26
LID - 10.1111/jgs.13562 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether prescription opioid use is associated with higher 
      dementia risk or greater cognitive decline. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. 
      SETTING: Group Health, an integrated healthcare delivery system. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Community-dwelling individuals aged 65 and older without dementia with at least 10 
      years of Group Health enrollment at baseline (N = 3,434; median age 74). 
      MEASUREMENTS: The Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) was administered 
      every 2 years. Low scores triggered detailed evaluation, and a multidisciplinary 
      committee assigned dementia diagnoses. From computerized pharmacy data, cumulative 
      opioid exposure was defined as total standardized doses (TSDs) dispensed over 10 
      years (excluding the most recent year because of possible prodromal symptoms). For 
      comparison, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), characterized 
      similarly, was examined. Dementia risk was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards 
      models and CASI trajectory using linear regression models and generalized estimating 
      equations. RESULTS: Seven hundred ninety-seven participants (23%) developed dementia 
      over a mean follow-up of 7.3 years; 637 (19%) had possible or probable Alzheimer's 
      disease. For cumulative opioid use, the hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia were 1.06 
      (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.88-1.26) for 11 to 30 TSDs, 0.88 (95% CI = 
      0.70-1.09) for 31 to 90 TSDs, and 1.29 (95% CI = 1.02-1.62) for 91 or more TSDs, 
      versus 0 to 10 TSDs. A similar pattern was seen for NSAID use. Heavier opioid use 
      was not associated with more-rapid cognitive decline. CONCLUSION: People with the 
      heaviest opioid or NSAID use had slightly higher dementia risk than people with 
      little or no use. These results may reflect an effect of chronic pain on cognition 
      or residual confounding. Although opioids have other risks, little evidence of 
      long-term cognitive harm specific to opioids was found.

TI  - Neuritin attenuates cognitive function impairments in tg2576 mouse model of 
      Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neuritin, also known as CPG15, is a neurotrophic factor that was initially 
      discovered in a screen to identify genes involved in activity-dependent synaptic 
      plasticity. Neuritin plays multiple roles in the process of neural development and 
      synaptic plasticity, although its binding receptor(s) and downstream signaling 
      effectors remain unclear. In this study, we found that the cortical and hippocampal 
      expression of neuritin is reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients 
      and demonstrated that viral-mediated expression of neuritin in the dentate gyrus of 
      13-month-old Tg2576 mice, an AD animal model, attenuated a deficit in learning and 
      memory as assessed by a Morris water maze test. We also found that neuritin restored 
      the reduction in dendritic spine density and the maturity of individual spines in 
      primary hippocampal neuron cultures prepared from Tg2576 mice. It was also shown 
      that viral-mediated expression of neuritin in the dentate gyrus of 7-week-old 
      Sprague-Dawley rats increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Taken together, our 
      results demonstrate that neuritin restores the reduction in dendritic spine density 
      and the maturity of individual spines in primary hippocampal neurons from Tg2576 
      neurons, and also attenuates cognitive function deficits in Tg2576 mouse model of 
      AD, suggesting that neuritin possesses a therapeutic potential for AD.

TI  - Identifying elderly depression using the Depression Rating Scale as part of 
      comprehensive standardised care assessment in nursing homes.
PG  - 1045-51
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2011.583626 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study used data from the SHELTER (Services and Health for Elderly 
      in Long TERm care) project to explore the benefits of using the Depression Rating 
      Scale (DRS) as part of a standardised needs assessment in UK nursing homes, 
      including a statistical method of effectively identifying characteristics linking to 
      residents' depression. METHOD: About 499 residents in nine nursing homes in 
      south-east England were assessed with interRAI Long Term Care Facilities (interRAI 
      LTCF), a standardised assessment tool containing the validated DRS residents who 
      scored 3 or more on the DRS were considered 'might suffer from depression'. A list 
      of characteristics associated with depression was then examined using bivariate 
      analysis and logistic regression. RESULTS: Among the 499 residents assessed, 67.5% 
      were not depressed (DRS < 3) and 32.3% might suffer from depression (DRS ≥ 3). The 
      final logistic model showed 'never married' (p = 0.019), 'diagnosis of COPD' (COPD, 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) (p = 0.015), 'feelings of pain' (p = 0.015) 
      and 'trouble sleeping' (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with reporting of 
      DRS score of 3 and more. CONCLUSION: The article argued that DRS has distinctive 
      advantages for using in UK nursing homes where a preponderance of residents is 
      cognitively impaired, the procedure of screening depression is not regulated and 
      resources to treat depression is relatively scarce. This article also demonstrated 
      how using the DRS as part of a comprehensive standardised needs assessment 
      facilitates analysis of characteristics linking to depression, which has significant 
      policy implications in improving care quality and management.

TI  - The Relevance of Bionian Thinking to the Treatment of PTSD Patients.
PG  - 729-49
LID - 10.1177/0003065116659459 [doi]
AB  - Analysts who conduct trauma-focused treatments have much to learn from Wilfred 
      Bion's contributions to the understanding and treatment of PTSD. Concepts such as 
      catastrophe and catastrophic change can illuminate the subjective experience of PTSD 
      patients, the beta screen concept sheds light on dissociative phenomena, and, as 
      shown in a clinical vignette, the analyst can use his alpha function to transform 
      the patient's fragmented raw material into alpha elements. A second clinical 
      vignette shows how during a cognitive intervention the analyst can impart this alpha 
      function to the patient and use his reverie to help the patient assimilate 
      previously intolerable fragments into a coherent narrative. Finally, the idea of 
      knowing mental pain (Bion's K) is discussed in relation to the processing of 
      traumatic memories.

TI  - The incidence of delirium in Norwegian intensive care units; deep sedation makes 
      assessment difficult.
PG  - 294-302
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2012.02793.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium in critically ill patients is associated with increased length 
      of hospital stay, mortality and costs, and may lead to long-term cognitive 
      impairment. It is often overlooked by clinicians if structured observation is not 
      performed routinely. A national Norwegian survey reported that systematic screening 
      and assessment of delirium were never or seldom performed. The purpose of this study 
      was to test the usefulness of the Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care 
      Unit (CAM-ICU) and to describe the incidence of delirium in critically ill patients 
      at two Norwegian hospitals. METHODS: We conducted a two-site, prospective, 
      descriptive study including patients between 18 and 80 years, intubated or mask 
      ventilated at admission, with an ICU stay > 48 h. The CAM-ICU was scored three times 
      daily. In addition, illness severity, sedation level, pain assessment, drug use and 
      other treatment factors were systematically assessed. RESULTS: Total ICU stays of 
      139 patients were studied and covered 958 patient days. The incidence of delirium 
      was 23%. Thirty per cent of the patients representing 407 patient days were unable 
      to be assessed at any assessment, mainly due to deep sedation. The patients were 
      delirium and coma free in 45.9% of total days. CONCLUSION: Of the patients, 23% were 
      classed as delirious (CAM-ICU positive) at least once during their stay. The CAM-ICU 
      was difficult to use in patients with sedation so deep that they hardly gave eye 
      contact and responded only weakly to verbal stimulation. Focusing on less sedation 
      and further modifications to the CAM-ICU may benefit ICU patients in the future.

TI  - Comprehensive Approach to Management of Multiple Sclerosis: Addressing Invisible 
      Symptoms-A Narrative Review.
PG  - 75-98
LID - 10.1007/s40120-021-00239-2 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune inflammatory disease of the central 
      nervous system, leading to neurodegeneration and manifesting as a variety of 
      symptoms. These can include "invisible" symptoms, not externally evident to others, 
      such as fatigue, mood disorders, cognitive impairments, pain, bladder/bowel 
      dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and vision changes. Invisible symptoms are highly 
      prevalent in people living with MS, with multifactorial etiology and potential to 
      impact the disease course. Patient experiences of these symptoms include both 
      physical and psychosocial elements, which when unaddressed negatively influence many 
      aspects of quality of life and perception of health. Despite the high impact on 
      patient lives, gaps persist in awareness and management of these hidden symptoms. 
      The healthcare provider and patient author experiences brought together here serve 
      to raise the profile of invisible symptoms and review strategies for a team-based 
      approach to comprehensive MS care. We summarize the current literature regarding the 
      prevalence and etiology of invisible symptoms to convey the high likelihood that a 
      person living with MS will contend with one or more of these concerns. We then 
      explore how open communication between people living with MS and their care team, 
      stigma mitigation, and shared decision-making are key to comprehensive management of 
      invisible symptoms. We recommend validated screening tools and technological 
      advancements that may be incorporated into MS care to regularly monitor these 
      symptoms, offering insight into how healthcare providers can both educate and listen

TI  - Improving the detection of chronic migraine: Development and validation of Identify 
      Chronic Migraine (ID-CM).
PG  - 203-15
LID - 10.1177/0333102415583982 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Migraine, particularly chronic migraine (CM), is underdiagnosed and 
      undertreated worldwide. Our objective was to develop and validate a 
      self-administered tool (ID-CM) to identify migraine and CM. METHODS: ID-CM was 
      developed in four stages. (1) Expert clinicians suggested candidate items from 
      existing instruments and experience (Delphi Panel method). (2) Candidate items were 
      reviewed by people with CM during cognitive debriefing interviews. (3) Items were 
      administered to a Web panel of people with severe headache to assess psychometric 
      properties and refine ID-CM. (4) Classification accuracy was assessed using an 
      ICHD-3β gold-standard clinician diagnosis. RESULTS: Stages 1 and 2 identified 20 
      items selected for psychometric validation in stage 3 (n = 1562). The 12 
      psychometrically robust items from stage 3 underwent validity testing in stage 4. A 
      scoring algorithm applied to four symptom items (moderate/severe pain intensity, 
      photophobia, phonophobia, nausea) accurately classified most migraine cases among 
      111 people (sensitivity = 83.5%, specificity = 88.5%). Augmenting this algorithm 
      with eight items assessing headache frequency, disability, medication use, and 
      planning disruption correctly classified most CM cases (sensitivity = 80.6%, 
      specificity = 88.6%). DISCUSSION: ID-CM is a simple yet accurate tool that correctly 
      classifies most individuals with migraine and CM. Further testing in other settings 
      will also be valuable.

TI  - Trends in diabetes medication use and prevalence of geriatric syndromes in older 
      Mexican Americans from 1993/1994 to 2004/2005.
PG  - 1376-83
LID - 10.1345/aph.1M724 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: New diabetes medications introduced over the last decade have led to 
      changes in diabetes treatment recommendations for the increasing number of elderly 
      patients with diabetes. It is, however, not clear whether these changes are 
      accompanied by changes in prevalence of comorbid geriatric syndromes. OBJECTIVE: To 
      determine whether changes in diabetes treatment between 1993/1994 and 2004/2005 were 
      accompanied by changes in prevalence of geriatric syndromes in Mexican Americans 
      aged 75 years and older. METHODS: Data from the Hispanic Established Population for 
      the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly were used. Participants aged 75 years and 
      older with diabetes in 1993/1994 (n = 284) and in 2004/2005 (n = 324; new cohort 
      added in 2004/2005) were included in the analyses. Medication use and geriatric 
      syndromes prevalence rates were estimated and compared using descriptive and 
      univariate statistics for continuous variables and contingency tables (chi(2)) for 
      categorical variables. RESULTS: Older Mexican Americans with diabetes in 2004/2005 
      were more likely to be taking 2 or more oral diabetes medications than were those in 
      the 1993/1994 cohort; most of the drugs taken by the 2004/2005 cohort were the newly 
      introduced oral diabetes medications. Use of insulin as sole diabetes therapy 
      decreased from 20.3% in the 1993/1994 cohort to 7.5% in the 2004/2005 cohort. The 
      2004/2005 cohort reported longer diabetes duration and higher prevalence of obesity 
      and hypertension; they were also more likely than the 1993/1994 cohort to have more 
      geriatric syndromes: pain, arthritis, incontinence, and self-reported activities of 
      daily living disability. No significant differences exist between the 2 cohorts in 
      objective measures of cognitive and physical function. CONCLUSIONS: Older Mexican 
      Americans with diabetes in 2004/2005 used more of the newer diabetes medications and 
      less insulin compared to the 1993/1994 cohort. The prevalence rates of geriatric 
      syndromes were higher in the 2004/2005 cohort. Our findings suggest that screening 
      for and treating comorbid geriatric syndromes is increasingly important for optimal 
      geriatric diabetes care.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress disorder and depression negatively impact general health status 
      after hand injury.
PG  - 515-22
LID - 10.1016/j.jhsa.2008.11.008 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To estimate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and 
      depression among hand-injured patients and assess the impact of these disorders on 
      general health status. METHODS: A total of 106 adult hand-injured patients (40 
      women, 66 men) with a mean age of 42 years (range, 18-79 years) participated. 
      Patients with a chronic mental illness or cognitive impairment were excluded. 
      Psychological status was assessed using the Revised Civilian Mississippi Scale for 
      PTSD and the Beck Depression Inventory. General health status was evaluated with the 
      Short Form-36 health survey (SF-36). We obtained demographics and injury 
      characteristics from the patient medical records. RESULTS: Prominent mechanisms of 
      injury included a fall (n = 38), traffic-related injuries (n = 14), machine versus 
      operator (n = 8), gunshot wounds (n = 6), and assault (n = 6). Using the screening 
      questionnaires, 32 persons qualified for PTSD and 19 for depression. Sixteen 
      patients met the criteria for both PTSD and depression. The association between PTSD 
      and depression was significant (p < .01). Patients with PTSD had significantly lower 
      scores than those who did not endorse items consistent with PTSD or depression on 
      the SF-36 subscales of role-emotional (p < .01), body pain (p = .013), social 
      function (p = .028), and mental health (p < .01). We found no significant 
      differences between groups for the subscales of role-physical (p = .289), general 
      health (p = .147), vitality (p = .496), and physical functioning (p = .476). 
      Patients who had concurrent PTSD and depression had significantly lower scores than 
      patients who had neither PTSD nor depression on all subscales (p < .05 for all) 
      except role-physical (p = .135). We found significant negative correlations between 
      Beck Depression Inventory scores and all of the SF-36 subscales (p < .05 for all). 
      CONCLUSIONS: In this study, nearly one third of hand-injured patients met diagnostic 
      criteria for PTSD, depression, or both, according to the thresholds of the 
      instruments used to measure these psychological aspects of illness. PTSD and 
      depression had a negative effect on general health status after hand injury. It may 
      be important to consider psychological status when caring for patients with hand 
      injuries.

TI  - Long-term cognitive and somatic outcomes of enzyme replacement therapy in 
      untransplanted Hurler syndrome.
PG  - 64-68
LID - 10.1016/j.ymgmr.2017.07.012 [doi]
AB  - Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening 
      Panel for newborn screening in 2016, highlighting recognition that early treatment 
      of MPS I is critical to stem progressive, irreversible disease manifestations. 
      Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an approved treatment for all MPS I phenotypes, 
      but because the severe form (MPS IH, Hurler syndrome) involves rapid neurocognitive 
      decline, the impermeable blood-brain-barrier is considered an obstacle for ERT. 
      Instead, hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has long been recommended, as it 
      is believed to be the only therapy that arrests neurocognitive decline. Yet ERT 
      monotherapy has never been compared to HCT, because it is unethically unacceptable 
      to evaluate a therapeutic alternative to one shown to treat Central Nervous System 
      (CNS) disease. An unusual opportunity to address this question is presented with 
      this clinical report of a 16-year-old female with MPS IH treated only with ERT since 
      her diagnosis at age 2. Neurological functioning was stable until cervical spinal 
      cord compression at age 8, hydrocephalus at age 11, and neurocognitive declines 
      beginning at age 10. Somatic disease burden is significant for first degree AV 
      block, restrictive lung disease, bilateral hearing loss, severe corneal clouding, 
      joint pain/limitations requiring mobility assistance, and short stature. This 
      patient's extended survival and prolonged intact neurocognitive functioning depart 
      from the untreated natural history of MPS IH. Disease burden typically controlled by 
      HCT emerged. Although not anticipated to provide benefit for CNS disease, ERT may 
      have provided some amelioration or slowing of neurocognitive deterioration.

TI  - The Evolutionary Stage of Cognitive Frailty and Its Changing Characteristics in Old 
      Adults.
PG  - 467-478
LID - 10.1007/s12603-020-1560-8 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the evolutionary stage of the elderly from 
      the normal to the cognitive frailty, and to identify the important factors which 
      influenced the changes of the cognitive frailty stage from the 
      «physiological-psychological-social» perspective. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A random cluster sampling was used to recruit 4,010 old 
      adults living in community from Shanxi province in China. MEASUREMENTS: Data were 
      collected by face-to-face questionnaire survey. Multinomial logistic regression was 
      used to screen the factors contributing to the 6 population groups with various 
      cognitive functions and frailty status. Principal component analysis was used to 
      redefine the evolutionary stages of cognitive frailty, while the orthogonal partial 
      least squares discrimination analysis and binary logistic regression were used to 
      identify the important factors and distinguish different stages and influence 
      directions. RESULTS: The factors contributing to the population with various 
      cognitive functions and frailty status were involved in all aspects of 
      «physical-psychological-social». Apart from normal group, other 5 groups were 
      clustered into «stage of frailty change» and « stage of cognitive frailty change». 
      Aging, early onset of chronic diseases, high pain intensity, and poor nutritional 
      status might deteriorate the individual's evolution from "normal stage" to "stage of 
      frailty change", while the increasing social activity might promote the individual's 
      health. Simultaneously, early onset of chronic diseases, high pain intensity and 
      poor nutritional status also played important roles in the evolution of individual 
      from "stage of frailty change" to "stage of cognitive frailty change". CONCLUSION: 
      The formation of cognitive frailty might experience the «normal-frailty-cognitive 
      frailty» stages change, and both the prevention and intervention of frailty might 
      delay the occurrence of cognitive frailty. Therefore, the strategies for both 
      prevention and intervention among old adults should be throughout centered on the 
      parts of preventing the premature onset of chronic diseases, carrying out 
      stage-tailored nutrition intervention, and establishing standardized pain 
      management, especially the part of increasing the social activities among older 
      adults.

AB  - AIMS: To provide a synopsis of the sixth survey of the Tromsø Study, Tromsø 6, 
      objectives and new target areas, study design, follow-up studies, data collection, 
      attendance, and participant characteristics. METHODS: The Tromsø Study, initiated in 
      1974, is an epidemiological, prospective study of health conditions and chronic 
      diseases, and a resource for the surveillance of disease risk factors. The purpose 
      of Tromsø 6 (2007-08) was to collect novel and repeated measurements of exposure 
      data and to assess levels of disease risk factors. Tromsø 6 included a main study 
      that comprised two screening visits and several follow-up studies. Main study data 
      collection: First visit (n=12,984): questionnaires, interviews, measurements of 
      height, weight, hip and waist circumference, heart rate, blood pressure, forearm 
      bone density, grip strength, pain sensitivity measurements, and blood and hair 
      samples and nose and throat swab cultures. Second visit (n=7307): sampling of 
      biological specimens (blood, urine, nose and throat swab cultures) and clinical 
      examinations (12-lead electrocardiography, cognitive tests, visual acuity test, 
      retinal photography, carotid ultrasound, spirometry, dual-energy X-ray 
      absorptiometry, and echocardiography. RESULTS: A total of 12,984 participants aged 
      30-87 years were examined. The attendance rate was 66%, lower than in previous 
      Tromsø Study surveys. The attendance was lowest in the youngest and oldest, those 
      invited for the first time, and lower in men than women. CONCLUSIONS: The completion 
      of the survey with this comprehensive data collection went satisfactorily. The 
      decreasing attendance rate calls for new recruitment strategies and optimisation of 
      the study organisation to facilitate attendance.

TI  - Assessing delirium with nursing care instruments: Evaluation of the cognitive and 
      associated domains.
PG  - 11-16
LID - 10.1017/S1478951520000620 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nursing instruments have the potential for daily screening of delirium; 
      however, they have not yet been evaluated. Therefore, after assessing the functional 
      domains of the electronic Patient Assessment - Acute Care (ePA-AC), this study 
      evaluates the cognitive and associated domains. METHODS: In this prospective cohort 
      study in the intensive care unit, 277 patients were assessed and 118 patients were 
      delirious. The impacts of delirium on the cognitive domains, consciousness and 
      cognition, communication and interaction, in addition to respiration, pain, and 
      wounds were determined with simple logistic regressions and their respective odds 
      ratios (ORs). RESULTS: Delirium was associated with substantial impairment 
      throughout the evaluated domains. Delirious patients were somnolent (OR 6), their 
      orientation (OR 8.2-10.6) and ability to acquire knowledge (OR 5.5-11.6) were 
      substantially impaired, they lost the competence to manage daily routines (OR 
      8.2-22.4), and their attention was compromised (OR 12.8). In addition, these 
      patients received psychotropics (OR 3.8), were visually impaired (OR 1.8), unable to 
      communicate their needs (OR 5.6-7.6), displayed reduced self-initiated activities 
      (OR 6.5-6.9) and challenging behaviors (OR 6.2), as well as sleep-wake disturbances 
      (OR 2.2-5), Furthermore, delirium was associated with mechanical ventilation, 
      abdominal/thoracic injuries or operations (OR 4.2-4.4), and sensory perception 
      impairment (OR 3.9-5.8). SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Delirium caused substantial 
      impairment in cognitive and associated domains. In addition to the previously 
      described functional impairments, these findings will aid the implementation of 
      nursing instruments in delirium screening.

TI  - Comparative safety of anti-epileptic drugs among infants and children exposed in 
      utero or during breastfeeding: protocol for a systematic review and network 
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 68
LID - 10.1186/2046-4053-3-68 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Epilepsy affects about 1% of the general population. Anti-epileptic 
      drugs (AEDs) prevent or terminate seizures in individuals with epilepsy. Pregnant 
      women with epilepsy may continue taking AEDs. Many of these agents cross the 
      placenta and increase the risk of major congenital malformations, early cognitive 
      and developmental delays, and infant mortality. We aim to evaluate the comparative 
      safety of AEDs approved for chronic use in Canada when administered to pregnant and 
      breastfeeding women and the effects on their infants and children through a 
      systematic review and network meta-analysis. METHODS: Studies examining the effects 
      of AEDs administered to pregnant and breastfeeding women regardless of indication 
      (e.g., epilepsy, migraine, pain, psychiatric disorders) on their infants and 
      children will be included. We will include randomized clinical trials (RCTs), 
      quasi-RCTs, non-RCTs, controlled before-after, interrupted time series, cohort, 
      registry, and case-control studies. The main literature search will be executed in 
      MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We will 
      seek unpublished literature through searches of trial protocol registries and 
      conference abstracts. The literature search results screening, data abstraction, and 
      risk of bias appraisal will be performed by two individuals, independently. 
      Conflicts will be resolved through discussion. The risk of bias of experimental and 
      quasi-experimental studies will be appraised using the Cochrane Effective Practice 
      and Organization of Care Risk-of-Bias tool, methodological quality of observational 
      studies will be appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale, and quality of reporting 
      of safety outcomes will be conducted using the McMaster Quality Assessment Scale of 
      Harms (McHarm) tool. If feasible and appropriate, we will conduct random effects 
      meta-analysis. Network meta-analysis will be considered for outcomes that fulfill 
      network meta-analysis assumptions.The primary outcome is major congenital 
      malformations (overall and by specific types), while secondary outcomes include 
      fetal loss/miscarriage, minor congenital malformations (overall and by specific 
      types), cognitive development, psychomotor development, small for gestational age, 
      preterm delivery, and neonatal seizures. DISCUSSION: Our systematic review will 
      address safety concerns regarding the use of AEDs during pregnancy and 
      breastfeeding. Our results will be useful to healthcare providers, policy-makers, 
      and women of childbearing age who are taking anti-epileptic medications. SYSTEMATIC

TI  - Screening performance of the 15-item geriatric depression scale in a diverse elderly 
      home care population.
PG  - 914-21
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e318186bd67 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To empirically evaluate the psychometric properties of the 15-item 
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15); determine the optimal cutoff points and 
      screening performance for the detection of major depression; and examine 
      differential item functioning (DIF) to determine the variability of item responses 
      across sociodemographics in an elderly home care population. DESIGN: A secondary 
      analysis of data collected from a random sample study. SETTING: Homebound subjects 
      newly admitted over a 2-year-period to a large visiting nurse service agency in 
      Westchester, New York. PARTICIPANTS: Five hundred twenty-six subjects over age 65, 
      newly admitted to home care for skilled nursing. MEASUREMENTS: Major depression was 
      diagnosed using both patient, Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and 
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, and best estimate 
      procedures. Self-report measures included the GDS-15, activities of daily living 
      (ADL), instrumental ADL, and pain intensity. Cognitive impairment was assessed using 
      the Mini-Mental State Examination and medical morbidity using the Charlson 
      Comorbidity Index. RESULTS: Optimal cutoff (5) yielded sensitivity 71.8% and 
      specificity of 78.2%, however, the accuracy of the GDS-15 was not influenced by 
      severity of medical burden. Persons with a cluster of ailments were twice as likely 
      (Adj odds ratio = 2.47; 95% confidence interval = 1.49-4.09) to be diagnosed with 
      depression. DIF analyses revealed no variability of item responses across 
      sociodemographics. CONCLUSION: Main findings suggest that the accuracy of the GDS-15 
      was not influenced by severity of clinical or functional factors, or 
      sociodemographics. This has broad implications suggesting that the very old, ill, 
      and diverse populations can be appropriately screened for depression using the 
      GDS-15.

PG  - 202-9
LID - 10.3109/09593985.2013.856508 [doi]
AB  - Acute low back pain (LBP) from injuries is prevalent in the work place. It has been 
      shown that patients with psychosocial factors often progress with persistent pain 
      and lead to significant workers compensation costs. Therapeutic Neuroscience 
      Education (TNE) has been shown to be beneficial in changing a patient's cognition 
      regarding their pain state, which may result in decrease fear, anxiety and 
      catastrophization. A 19-year-old female who developed LBP from a work injury was the 
      patient for this case report. A physical examination, Numeric Pain Rating Scale 
      (NRPS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire 
      (FABQ), Keele STarT Back Screening Tool (Keele SBST) and Acute Low Back Pain 
      Screening (ALBPS) Questionnaires were assessed during initial physical therapy visit 
      and discharge. Treatment consisted of use of TNE, manual therapy and exercises. She 
      attended five total visits over a 2-week period prior to full discharge. During the 
      initial visit the patient reported NRPS = 3/10, ODI = 36%, FABQ-PA = 23, 
      FABQ-W = 30, Keele SBST = 4/9, ALBPS = 101. At discharge the patient reported a 0 on 
      all outcome questionnaires with ability to return to full work and no pain 
      complaints.

TI  - Risk factors for restriction in activity associated with fear of falling among 
      seniors within the community.
PG  - 187-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the significance of falling, fear of falling may represent a 
      greater pervasive concern to the health of seniors. Activity restriction, resulting 
      from fear of falling, which may or may not develop after a fall, may lead to balance 
      deterioration, functional decline, anxiety or reductions in social/leisure/physical 
      activity opportunities, and, consequently, compromised quality of life and health. 
      METHODS: The purpose of this research was to determine the risk factors for activity 
      restriction resulting from fear of falling among community-based seniors using an 
      early version of the interRAI Community Health Assessment (interRAI CHA). All 
      participants (n = 560) were enrolled in 1 of 5 different fall intervention programs 
      in Ontario funded through the Falls Prevention Initiative sponsored by Health Canada 
      and Veterans Affairs Canada. All participants (or a predetermined number of seniors 
      if the subject pool was extensive) were assessed both before and after intervention. 
      Subjects were assessed using the interRAI CHA. RESULTS: Thirty-five percent of 
      seniors reported restricting their activity as a result of fear of falling. Risk 
      factors predictive of activity restriction included previous history of falling, 
      compromised instrumental activities of daily living, compromised cognitive 
      performance, presence of pain, female sex, and impaired gait. CONCLUSIONS: Fear of 
      falling is a prevalent issue among seniors, which has the potential to alter their 
      quality of life and morbidity, and as such, including fear of falling in public 
      health programs, health policies, and screening efforts seems imperative. The 
      present findings add to the present research on risk factors for activity 
      restriction because of fear of falling. These findings do not advocate for 
      restriction of activity to prevent falls because restriction is not a good solution 
      to fall prevention. Using a standardized and comprehensive tool such as the interRAI 
      CHA would assist researchers in making comparisons between different research groups 
      as well as assessing fear of falling from a multidisciplinary perspective.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An unresolved question is the time required for the ability to return to 
      complex tasks following anesthesia. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to characterize the 
      severity and duration of cognitive impairment following sevoflurane or desfluane 
      anesthesia after brief surgery using tests of cognitive ability to objectively 
      testing performance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study is a double blinded randomized 
      controlled trial. Patients were randomized to receive either a desflurane or 
      sevoflurane-based anesthetic. On the morning of the surgery the subjects performed 
      baseline cognitive task tests (Mini Mental Status exam, Trail Making Test Part A and 
      B, Digit Symbol Coding, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, Stroop Color and Word Test to 
      determine baseline cognitive function. Cognitive testing was repeated 30 minutes and 
      1 hour after surgery whereas Modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status 
      (TICS-M) and Memory Aging Telephone Screen (MATS) was used on the following day of 
      surgery. RESULTS: Trail Making Test Part B cognitive test showed statistically 
      significant in comparison for pre and post exposure of anesthetics. This difference 
      was seen in the desflurane group. Other cognitive tests did not show differences on 
      exposure to the anesthetic gases. CONCLUSIONS: This study questioned the difference 
      between volatile anesthetic agent's effects on patients completing a battery of 
      neurocognitive tests attempting to answer if one agent has a more profound effect. 
      Our study shows no statistically significant cognitive decline except for those in 
      the Trail Making Part B in the Desflurane group. This conclusion is limited by the 
      inherent limitations of the study, but does reinforce that the systemic inflammatory 
      response from the surgery contributes cognitive impairment.

AB  - 3xTg-AD mutant mice are characterized by parenchymal Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary 
      tangles resembling those found in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The mutants 
      were compared with non-transgenic controls in sensorimotor and learning tests. 
      3xTg-AD mutants were deficient in T-maze reversal, object recognition, and passive 
      avoidance learning. In addition, the mutants showed hypoactivity in two open-field 
      tests, fewer fecal boli in an observation jar, and reduced enclosed arm entries and 
      head-dipping in the elevated plus-maze. On the contrary, the mutants did not differ 
      from controls in pain thresholds, nest-building, and various reflexes determined by 
      the SHIRPA primary screen and were even better on the rotorod test of motor 
      coordination.

TI  - Use of the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) as a treatment outcome measure for 
      patients with chronic spinal pain disorder in a functional restoration program.
PG  - 1819-1829
LID - S1529-9430(17)30270-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.spinee.2017.06.008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) is a valid and 
      reliable patient-reported instrument designed to identify patients whose presenting 
      symptoms may be related to central sensitization (CS). Part A of the CSI measures a 
      full array of 25 somatic and emotional symptoms associated with CS, and Part B asks 
      if patients have previously been diagnosed with one or more specific central 
      sensitivity syndromes (CSSs) and related disorders. The CSI has previously been 
      validated in a group of patients with chronic pain who were screened by a trained 
      psychiatrist for specific CSS diagnoses. It is currently unknown if the CSI can be a 
      useful treatment-outcome assessment tool for patients with chronic spinal pain 
      disorder (CSPD) who are not screened for comorbid CSSs. It is known, however, that 
      previous studies have identified CS-related symptoms, and comorbid CSSs, in subsets 
      of patients with CSPDs. Studies have also shown that CS-related symptoms can be 
      influenced by cognitive and psychosocial factors, including abuse history in both 
      childhood and adulthood, sleep disturbance, catastrophic and fear-avoidant 
      cognitions, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. PURPOSE: This study aimed to 
      evaluate CSI scores, and their associations with other clinically relevant 
      psychosocial variables, in a cohort of patients with CSPD who entered and completed 
      a functional restoration program. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: A retrospective study of 
      prospectively collected data from a cohort study of patients with CSPD, who 
      completed the CSI at admission to, and discharge from, an interdisciplinary function 
      restoration program (FRP) was carried out. PATIENT SAMPLE: A cohort of 763 patients 
      with CSPD comprised the study sample. OUTCOME MEASURES: Clinical interviews 
      evaluated mood disorders and abuse history. A series of self-reported measures 
      evaluated comorbid psychosocial symptoms, including pain intensity, pain-related 
      anxiety, depressive symptoms, somatization symptoms, perceived disability, and sleep 
      disturbance, at FRP admission and discharge. METHODS: Patients were grouped into 
      five severity level groups, from mild to extreme, based on total CSI scores, at FRP 
      admission, and then again at discharge. The FRP included a quantitatively directed 
      and medically supervised exercise process, as well as a multimodal psychosocial 
      disability management component. RESULTS: The CSI severity groups were strongly 
      associated with Major Depressive Disorder and previous abuse history (p<.01), which 
      are known risk factors for CS-related symptoms and diagnoses. The CSI scores were 
      also strongly associated with patient-reported CSS diagnoses on CSI Part B. The 
      percentage of patients who reported a comorbid CSS diagnosis increased in each 
      higher CSI-severity group, from 11% in the Subclinical group, to 56% in the Extreme 
      group. The CSI severity groups were significantly related to other CS-related 
      patient-reported symptoms, including pain intensity, pain-related anxiety, 
      depressive symptoms, somatization symptoms, perceived disability, and sleep 
      disturbance (p's<.001). The CSI scores, along with all other psychosocial measures, 
      decreased at treatment discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, admission CSI 
      scores were highly associated with previous CSS diagnoses, CS-related symptoms, and 
      clinically relevant patient-reported psychosocial variables. All psychosocial 
      variables, as well as scores on the CSI, were significantly improved at FRP 
      discharge. The CSI may have important clinical utility, as a screener and as a 
      treatment outcome measure, for patients with CSPD participating in an 
      interdisciplinary FRP.

TI  - Spectrum of acute clinical characteristics of diagnosed concussions in college 
      athletes wearing instrumented helmets: clinical article.
PG  - 1092-9
LID - 10.3171/2012.8.JNS112298 [doi]
AB  - OBJECT: Concussive head injuries have received much attention in the medical and 
      public arenas, as concerns have been raised about the potential short- and long-term 
      consequences of injuries sustained in sports and other activities. While many 
      student athletes have required evaluation after concussion, the exact definition of 
      concussion has varied among disciplines and over time. The authors used data 
      gathered as part of a multiinstitutional longitudinal study of the biomechanics of 
      head impacts in helmeted collegiate athletes to characterize what signs, symptoms, 
      and clinical histories were used to designate players as having sustained 
      concussions. METHODS: Players on 3 college football teams and 4 ice hockey teams 
      (male and female) wore helmets instrumented with Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) 
      technology during practices and games over 2-4 seasons of play. Preseason clinical 
      screening batteries assessed baseline cognition and reported symptoms. If a 
      concussion was diagnosed by the team medical staff, basic descriptive information 
      was collected at presentation, and concussed players were reevaluated serially. The 
      specific symptoms or findings associated with the diagnosis of acute concussion, 
      relation to specific impact events, timing of symptom onset and diagnosis, and 
      recorded biomechanical parameters were analyzed. RESULTS: Data were collected from 
      450 athletes with 486,594 recorded head impacts. Forty-eight separate concussions 
      were diagnosed in 44 individual players. Mental clouding, headache, and dizziness 
      were the most common presenting symptoms. Thirty-one diagnosed cases were associated 
      with an identified impact event; in 17 cases no specific impact event was 
      identified. Onset of symptoms was immediate in 24 players, delayed in 11, and 
      unspecified in 13. In 8 cases the diagnosis was made immediately after a head 
      impact, but in most cases the diagnosis was delayed (median 17 hours). One diagnosed 
      concussion involved a 30-second loss of consciousness; all other players retained 
      alertness. Most diagnoses were based on self-reported symptoms. The mean peak 
      angular and rotational acceleration values for those cases associated with a 
      specific identified impact were 86.1 ± 42.6g (range 16.5-177.9 g) and 3620 ± 2166 
      rad/sec( 2 ) (range 183-7589 rad/sec( 2 )), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Approximately 
      two-thirds of diagnosed concussions were associated with a specific contact event. 
      Half of all players diagnosed with concussions had delayed or unclear timing of 
      onset of symptoms. Most had no externally observed findings. Diagnosis was usually 
      based on a range of self-reported symptoms after a variable delay. Accelerations 
      clustered in the higher percentiles for all impact events, but encompassed a wide 
      range. These data highlight the heterogeneity of criteria for concussion diagnosis, 
      and in this sports context, its heavy reliance on self-reported symptoms. More 
      specific and standardized definitions of clinical and objective correlates of a 
      "concussion spectrum" may be needed in future research efforts, as well as in the 
      clinical diagnostic arena.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess which osmolarity equation best predicts directly measured 
      serum/plasma osmolality and whether its use could add value to routine blood test 
      results through screening for dehydration in older people. DESIGN: Diagnostic 
      accuracy study. PARTICIPANTS: Older people (≥65 years) in 5 cohorts: Dietary 
      Strategies for Healthy Ageing in Europe (NU-AGE, living in the community), 
      Dehydration Recognition In our Elders (DRIE, living in residential care), Fortes 
      (admitted to acute medical care), Sjöstrand (emergency room) or Pfortmueller cohorts 
      (hospitalised with liver cirrhosis). REFERENCE STANDARD FOR HYDRATION STATUS: 
      Directly measured serum/plasma osmolality: current dehydration (serum 
      osmolality>300 mOsm/kg), impending/current dehydration (≥295 mOsm/kg). INDEX TESTS: 
      39 osmolarity equations calculated using serum indices from the same blood draw as 
      directly measured osmolality. RESULTS: Across 5 cohorts 595 older people were 
      included, of whom 19% were dehydrated (directly measured osmolality>300 mOsm/kg). Of 
      39 osmolarity equations, 5 showed reasonable agreement with directly measured 
      osmolality and 3 had good predictive accuracy in subgroups with diabetes and poor 
      renal function. Two equations were characterised by narrower limits of agreement, 
      low levels of differential bias and good diagnostic accuracy in receiver operating 
      characteristic plots (areas under the curve>0.8). The best equation was 
      osmolarity=1.86×(Na++K+)+1.15×glucose+urea+14 (all measured in mmol/L). It appeared 
      useful in people aged ≥65 years with and without diabetes, poor renal function, 
      dehydration, in men and women, with a range of ages, health, cognitive and 
      functional status. CONCLUSIONS: Some commonly used osmolarity equations work poorly, 
      and should not be used. Given costs and prevalence of dehydration in older people we 
      suggest use of the best formula by pathology laboratories using a cutpoint of 
      295 mOsm/L (sensitivity 85%, specificity 59%), to report dehydration risk 
      opportunistically when serum glucose, urea and electrolytes are measured for other 
      reasons in older adults. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBERS: DRIE: Research Register for 
      Social Care, 122273; NU-AGE: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01754012.

TI  - The utility of the Beck Depression Inventory Fast Screen (BDI-FS) in a pain clinic 
      population.

LID - 10.1016/j.ejpain.2008.09.017 [doi]
AB  - This study compared the BDI-FS to the BDI-II in a sample of patients with chronic 
      pain. The objectives were to: look at agreement between measures, determine BDI-FS 
      cut-off scores, develop a conversion formula, consider the usefulness of the suicide 
      ideation item and compare ability to detect clinical change. Phase I: Archival data 
      from 1227 patients assessed for a pain management programme was analysed. The BDI-FS 
      displayed good internal consistency (alpha=.839). ROC curve analysis showed good 
      agreement between the BDI-II and FS and suggested a BDI-FS cut-off of four 
      corresponded to the 19 cut-off recommended in the BDI-II manual. We recommend a 
      cut-off of five to correspond to a BDI-II cut-off of 22 for pain clinic patients 
      recommended by previous research. Regression suggested BDI-II score=(2.77 x BDI-FS 
      score)+9.14. Our data support the clinical usefulness of the suicide ideation item 
      in this population. Phase II: Archival data from 584 patients collected at baseline, 
      following a 16 day pain management programme and at 6 months follow-up, was 
      analysed. Effect sizes indicated equivalent sensitivity to clinical change. The 
      BDI-FS showed good psychometric properties, strong agreement with the BDI-II and 
      equal ability to detect clinical change in a pain clinic population. The BDI-FS has 
      the practical advantages of faster administration and reduced patient burden.

TI  - What counts? Visual and verbal cues interact to influence what is considered a 
      countable thing.
PG  - 798-810
LID - 10.3758/s13421-015-0505-7 [doi]
AB  - Many famous paintings illustrate variations in what we here dub "referential depth." 
      For example, paintings often include not only portrayals of uniquely referenced 
      items, but also reflections of those items in mirrors or other polished surfaces. If 
      a painting includes both a dancer and that dancer's reflection in a mirror, are 
      there one or two dancers in the painting? Although there are two images of a dancer, 
      both images reference the exact same dancer. Consequently, counting both may seem to 
      violate the constraint against double counting (Gelman & Gallistel, 1978). This 
      illustrates that determining which things "count" in a given context may not be 
      straightforward. Here we used counting tasks paired with illustrations that 
      manipulated referential depth to investigate the conceptual, perceptual, and 
      language variables that may influence whether a "thing" is a "countable thing." 
      Across four experiments, 316 participants counted items in displays that included 
      both foreground items and items placed inside mirrors, picture frames, and windows. 
      Referential depth and frame boundaries both influenced counting: For one thing, 
      participants were more likely to count items contained by windows than by picture 
      frames or mirrors. Moreover, items in mirrors were rarely counted unless they were 
      interpreted as reflections of items "off screen." Also, the items contained inside 
      windows were sometimes (~10% of trials) excluded from the counts, when counting them 
      would require crossing frame boundaries. We concluded that conceptual and perceptual 
      contexts both influence people's decisions about the physical boundaries of the 
      to-be-counted set and which items within these boundaries are countable.

TI  - Direct evidence of central nervous system axonal damage in patients with 
      postoperative delirium: A preliminary study of pNF-H as a promising serum biomarker.
PG  - 39-44
LID - S0304-3940(17)30411-1 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neulet.2017.05.023 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Approximately 50-80% patients experience postoperative delirium, an 
      acute cognitive dysfunction associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased 
      mortality, excess healthcare costs, and persistent cognitive impairment. Elucidation 
      of the mechanism of delirium and associated diagnostic and therapeutic measures are 
      urgently required. Here we investigated the role of phosphorylated neurofilament 
      heavy subunit (pNF-H), a major structural protein in axons, as a predictive maker of 
      postoperative delirium. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent 
      surgery for abdominal cancer were screened for postoperative delirium, and they were 
      assessed for its severity using the memorial delirium assessment scale (MDAS) at and 
      48h after delirium onset. Serum pNF-H levels were also measured at both time points. 
      The patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of 
      pNF-H. Clinical variables were compared between groups using the Mann-Whitney U 
      test, and the relationship between pNF-H levels and delirium severity was analyzed 
      using the exponential curve fitting. RESULTS: Fifteen of the 23 (65.2%) patients 
      tested positive for pNF-H, and these patients exhibited significantly higher MDAS 
      scores compared with the pNF-H-negative patients only at the onset of delirium. 
      Although the MDAS score significantly improved over time in the positive group, 
      pNF-H positivity persisted. There was a correlation between the maximum pNF-H level 
      and maximum MDAS score (R(2)=0.31, p=0.013). CONCLUSIONS: More severe postoperative 
      delirium was directly related to higher serum pNF-H levels, suggesting the potential 
      application of pNF-H as a quantitative biomarker of neural damage in postoperative 
      delirium.

PG  - 298-305
LID - 10.1097/JGP.0b013e318235b758 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: : The symptom experience of community-dwelling persons with dementia 
      adopting an open-ended approach has not been well documented. We sought to identify 
      the most bothersome symptoms experienced using self and caregiver report, and to 
      evaluate whether these symptoms are captured by commonly used symptom-assessment 
      measures including the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS, standard in 
      palliative care), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), and End-of-Life Dementia 
      Scale-Symptom Management (ELDS-SM). DESIGN: : The authors use data from the 
      Palliative Excellence in Alzheimer Care Efforts (PEACE) study to characterize the 
      symptom experience. SETTING: : PEACE included outpatient primary care geriatric 
      patients in an urban setting affiliated with the University of Chicago. 
      PARTICIPANTS: : Data were examined from the 150 patient-caregiver dyads. 
      MEASUREMENTS: : The most bothersome symptoms of persons with dementia during the 
      past week were reported separately by self and family caregiver. Symptoms were asked 
      in an open-ended format and qualitative analysis using constant comparative 
      technique was applied for each response. Reports were categorized and frequencies 
      tabulated. RESULTS: : One hundred fifteen persons (35 could not respond to the 
      interview questions) with dementia reported 135 symptoms (median 1, range: 0-3). The 
      most frequently reported symptoms were pain (N = 48; 42%), depression (N = 13; 11%), 
      cognitive deficit (N = 12; 10%), anxiety (N = 7; 6%), and ophthalmologic complaint 
      (N = 5; 4%). One hundred fifty caregivers reported 259 symptoms (median 2, range: 
      0-5) with cognitive deficit (N = 71; 47%), pain (N = 46; 30%), depression (N = 26; 
      17%), activity disturbance (N = 23; 15%), and thought and perceptual disturbances (N 
      = 12; 8%) being reported most frequently. The ESAS, NPI, and ELDS-SM missed two or 
      more of the most commonly reported symptoms by dyads of persons with dementia and 
      their family caregivers. CONCLUSION: : Symptoms were frequently reported by persons 
      with dementia and their caregiver; however, commonly used symptom assessment 
      measures overlooked important symptoms. All physicians should be vigilant about 
      screening for both psychologic and physical symptoms in this population.

AB  - AIM: To conduct a systematic review evaluating improvement in team and leadership 
      performance and resuscitation outcomes after such a training of healthcare providers 
      during advanced life support (ALS) courses. METHODS: This systematic review asked 
      the question of whether students taking structured and standardised ALS courses in 
      an educational setting which include specific leadership or team training, compared 
      to no such specific training in these courses, improves patient survival, skill 
      performance in actual resuscitations, skill performance at 3-15 months (patient 
      tasks, teamwork, leadership), skill performance at course conclusion (patient tasks, 
      teamwork, leadership), or cognitive knowledge PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane 
      database were searched until April 2020. Screening of articles, analysis of risk of 
      bias, outcomes and quality assessment were performed according to the Grading of 
      Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology. Only studies 
      with abstracts in English were included. RESULTS: 14 non-randomised studies and 17 
      randomised controlled trials, both in adults and children, and seven studies 
      involving patients were included in this systematic review. No randomised controlled 
      trials but three observational studies of team and leadership training showed 
      improvement in the critical outcome of "patient survival". However, they suffered 
      from risk of bias (indirectness and imprecision). The included studies reported many 
      different methods to teach leadership skills and team behaviour. CONCLUSION: This 
      systematic review found very low certainty evidence that team and leadership 
      training as part of ALS courses improved patient outcome. This supports the 
      inclusion of team and leadership training in ALS courses for healthcare providers.

TI  - Subjective Cognitive Symptoms During a Migraine Attack: A Prospective Study of a 
      Clinic-Based Sample.
PG  - E137-50
AB  - BACKGROUND: A migraine attack aggregates a range of different symptoms, besides 
      pain, that contribute to attack-related disability. Cognitive dysfunction is an 
      unacknowledged part of the migraine attack. OBJECTIVE: To provide a profile of the 
      frequency and character of migraine attack-related cognitive symptoms occurring 
      during the headache phase of the attack. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. 
      SETTING: Clinical-based sample of episodic migraine patients. METHODS: Sequential 
      patients were screened about the occurrence of cognitive symptoms during migraine 
      attacks using an open-ended question followed by a self-fulfilled symptom checklist. 
      RESULTS: Of 165 migraine patients (15 men, age average 37.3 ± 10.7 years), 89.7% 
      described cognitive symptoms during the headache phase of the migraine attack. On 
      average 2.5 ± 1.6 symptoms were reported per patient, uninfluenced by demographic or 
      disease-related variables. The most common spontaneous symptoms related to executive 
      functions, such as poor ability to concentrate (37%), difficulty in reasoning (25%), 
      and thinking (23%). The pattern of responses on the symptoms checklist corroborated 
      with those reported spontaneously and quantitative scores of the checklist were 
      higher in patients with spontaneous symptoms. LIMITATIONS: Open-ended questions tend 
      to overestimate frequency; data accuracy may be influenced by the population chosen 
      (clinical-based, some using prophylactic treatment). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      detailed the frequency and characteristics of migraine attack-related subjective 
      cognitive symptoms and found its frequency to be similar to reports of other 
      migraine defining symptoms (ex. nausea, photophobia) in recent clinical series. 
      Patients' reports were consistent and dominated by complaints of attention 
      difficulties, diminished cognitive efficiency, and processing speed impairment.

TI  - Efficacy of temporary work modifications on disability related to musculoskeletal 
      pain or depressive symptoms--study protocol for a controlled trial.
PG  - e008300
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2015-008300 [doi]
LID - e008300
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Previous research suggests that work with a suitable workload may 
      promote health and work retention in people with disability. This study will examine 
      whether temporary work modifications at the early stage of work disability are 
      effective in enhancing return to work (RTW) or staying at work among workers with 
      musculoskeletal or depressive symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A single-centre 
      controlled trial with modified stepped wedge design will be carried out in eight 
      enterprises and their occupational health services (OHSs) in nine cities in Finland. 
      Patients seeking medical advice due to musculoskeletal pain (≥4 on a scale from 
      0-10) or depressive symptoms (≥1 positive response to 2 screening questions) and 
      fulfilling other inclusion criteria are eligible. The study involves an educational 
      intervention among occupational physicians to enhance the initiation of work 
      modifications. Primary outcomes are sustained RTW (≥4 weeks at work without a new 
      sickness absence (SA)) and the total number of SA days during a 12-month follow-up. 
      Secondary outcomes are intensity of musculoskeletal pain (scale 0-10), pain 
      interference with work or sleep (scale 0-10) and severity of depressive symptoms 
      (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9), inquired via online questionnaires at 
      baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after recruitment. Information on SA days will be 
      collected from the medical records of the OHSs over 12 months, before and after 
      recruitment. The findings will give new information about the possibilities of 
      training physicians to initiate work modifications and their effects on RTW in 
      employees with work disability due to musculoskeletal pain or depressive symptoms. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Coordinating Ethics Committee of Hospital District of 
      Helsinki and Uusimaa has granted approval for this study. The results will be 
      published in peer-reviewed journals. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ISRCTN74743666.

TI  - Risk prediction models for emergence delirium in paediatric general anaesthesia: a 
      systematic review.
PG  - e043968
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2020-043968 [doi]
LID - e043968
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Emergence delirium (ED) occurs in approximately 25% of paediatric 
      general anaesthetics and has significant adverse effects. The goal of the current 
      systematic review was to identify the existing literature investigating performance 
      of predictive models for the development of paediatric ED following general 
      anaesthesia and to determine their usability. DESIGN: Systematic review using the 
      Prediction model study Risk Of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) framework. DATA 
      SOURCES: Medline (Ovid), PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Database of Systematic 
      Reviews (Ovid), Cochrane CENTRAL (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus (Elsevier) and Web 
      of Science (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials 
      Registry Platform and ProQuest Digital Dissertations and Theses International 
      through 17 November 2020. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: All randomised 
      controlled trials and cohort studies investigating predictive models for the 
      development of ED in children undergoing general anaesthesia. DATA EXTRACTION AND 
      SYNTHESIS: Following title, abstract and full-text screening by two reviewers, data 
      were extracted from all eligible studies, including demographic parameters, details 
      of anaesthetics and performance characteristics of the predictive scores for ED. 
      Evidence quality and predictive score usability were assessed according to the 
      PROBAST framework. RESULTS: The current systematic review yielded 9242 abstracts, of 
      which only one study detailing the development and validation of the Emergence 
      Agitation Risk Scale (EARS) met the inclusion criteria. EARS had good discrimination 
      with c-index of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.89). Calibration showed a non-significant 
      Homer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (p=0.97). Although the EARS demonstrated low 
      concern of applicability, the high risk of bias compromised the overall usability of 
      this model. CONCLUSIONS: The current systematic review concluded that EARS has good 
      discrimination performance but low usability to predict ED in a paediatric 
      population. Further research is warranted to develop novel models for the prediction 
      of ED in paediatric anaesthesia. PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42019141950.

TI  - Functional dyspepsia: outcome of focus groups for the development of a questionnaire 
      for symptom assessment in patients suffering from postprandial distress syndrome 
      (PDS).
PG  - 1266-74
LID - 10.1111/nmo.12381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To date, no patient reported outcomes (PRO) instrument is available for 
      evaluation of treatment efficacy in functional dyspepsia (FD)/postprandial distress 
      syndrome (PDS). The aim of our study was to perform focus group interviews for the 
      development of a new questionnaire for assessing symptom pattern and severity in 
      PDS. METHODS: Random ambulatory patients diagnosed with FD/PDS based on Rome III 
      criteria and no predominant gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms were 
      invited to participate. Focus group sessions were organized where patients reported 
      and discussed their symptoms, facilitated by an experienced physician. After 
      reaching saturation of identified symptom items, questions for a pilot PRO 
      instrument were drafted and evaluated in cognitive interviews for relevance, 
      clarity, and consistency. KEY RESULTS: Of 225 screened patients, 26 patients were 
      diagnosed with PDS without overlapping GERD as single final diagnosis. Fifteen of 
      these (87% female, 48 ± 3.2 years) participated in one of three focus groups. All 
      (100%) confirmed experiencing symptoms that were triggered or aggravated by 
      ingestion of a meal, corresponding to early satiation (100%), and postprandial 
      fullness (100%). In addition reported gastroduodenal symptoms were nausea (40%, 
      postprandial in all, interprandial in 20%), upper abdominal bloating (33%), 
      excessive belching (27%), and vomiting (13%). Epigastric pain and burning were 
      present in respectively 20% and 13%. Non-gastroduodenal symptoms that patients 
      reported included heartburn (33%, but mostly sporadic), weight loss (93%, on average 
      5.0 ± 1.7 kg), and fatigue (67%). Questions evaluating these symptoms were validated 
      in 15 cognitive interviews. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: This focus group study 
      confirms symptoms corresponding to postprandial fullness and early satiation as the 
      key items for developing a PRO for PDS.

TI  - Predictors of health care utilization in adult survivors of childhood cancer exposed 
      to central nervous system-directed therapy.
PG  - 774-82
LID - 10.1002/cncr.29121 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancer treated with central nervous system 
      (CNS)-directed therapy may be at risk for poor health care utilization because of 
      neurocognitive deficits. This study examined associations between neurocognitive 
      function and adherence to routine and risk-based medical evaluations in adult 
      survivors exposed to CNS-directed therapy. METHODS: Neurocognitive function and 
      health care utilization were assessed in 1304 adult survivors of childhood cancer 
      enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study. Adherence to recommended care was 
      defined as meeting guidelines published by the Children's Oncology Group. 
      Multivariate models were used to evaluate associations between neurocognitive 
      function and health screenings. Established predictors of health care utilization 
      were included as covariates. Odds ratios (ORs) or prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for variables maintained in the final 
      models. RESULTS: Adherence to recommended medical care was higher for routine care 
      (general physician care, 57.6%; dental care, 49.1%) versus specialized care 
      (survivor-focused care, 21.9%; echocardiogram, 19.9%). Higher intelligence was 
      predictive of general physician care (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.41-2.15) and 
      survivor-focused care (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13-1.83) in comparison with no care, 
      whereas better executive function skills were associated with reduced dental care 
      (PR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.91-0.98). Echocardiogram monitoring was not associated with 
      neurocognition. Possible late effects of cancer treatment (pain and reduced 
      cardiorespiratory fitness) were associated with an increased likelihood of receiving 
      specialized medical care. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors with reduced global cognition are 
      at risk for poor health care utilization. Educational practices regarding 
      recommended health care should be personalized to ensure comprehension by survivors 
      with neurocognitive impairment.

AB  - Fibromyalgia is a chronic condition characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, 
      non-restorative sleep and cognitive difficulties that affects 2-4% of the general 
      population. Recently a possible relationship between the FMR1 premutation and 
      fibromyalgia has been pointed out. In attempt to gather more data we screened for 
      the FMR1 CGG expansion 700 DNA samples from unrelated fibromyalgia patients. This 
      data might be useful for evaluating the incorporation of this test in rheumatologic 
      procedures for women with fibromyalgia. The observed frequency of FMR1 premutation 
      carriers (3 of 700, 0.4%) is not significantly different from the estimated rate in 
      the general female population (1/250-1/400) (P=0.539, P=0.716). Clinical examination 
      of the FMR1 premutation carriers identified revealed that all of them had important 
      neurological symptoms with regard to muscular symptoms, neurocognitive alterations 
      and neurovegetative impairments. With regard to other clinical aspects of the 
      disease the cases apparently did not differ from the average fibromyalgia patients. 
      On the basis of our results an FMR1 screening among fibromyalgia female patients 
      would not be recommended. However it would be worthwhile to further evaluate the 
      different clinical presentations that fibromyalgia patients might present based on 
      their FMR1 premutation carrier status.

TI  - Hippocampal dysfunction in Gulf War veterans: investigation with ASL perfusion MR 
      imaging and physostigmine challenge.
PG  - 218-25
LID - 10.1148/radiol.11101715 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To determine, with arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion magnetic 
      resonance (MR) imaging and physostigmine challenge, if abnormal hippocampal blood 
      flow in ill Gulf War veterans persists 11 years after initial testing with single 
      photon emission computed tomography and nearly 20 years after the 1991 Gulf War. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The local institutional review board approved this 
      HIPAA-compliant study. Veterans were screened for contraindications and gave written 
      informed consent before the study. In a semiblinded retrospective protocol, veterans 
      in three Gulf War illness groups-syndrome 1 (impaired cognition), syndrome 2 
      (confusion-ataxia), and syndrome 3 (central neuropathic pain)-and a control group 
      received intravenous infusions of saline in an initial session and physostigmine in 
      a second session, 48 hours later. Each infusion was followed by measurement of 
      hippocampal regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with pulsed ASL. A mixed-effects 
      linear model adjusted for age was used to test for differences in rCBF after the 
      cholinergic challenge across the four groups. RESULTS: Physostigmine significantly 
      decreased hippocampal rCBF in control subjects (P < .0005) and veterans with 
      syndrome 1 (P < .05) but significantly increased hippocampal rCBF in veterans with 
      syndrome 2 (P < .005) and veterans with syndrome 3 (P < .002). The abnormal increase 
      in rCBF was found to have progressed to the left hippocampus of the veterans with 
      syndrome 2 and to both hippocampi of the veterans with syndrome 3. CONCLUSION: 
      Chronic hippocampal perfusion dysfunction persists or worsens in veterans with 
      certain Gulf War syndromes. ASL MR imaging examination of hippocampal rCBF in a 
      cholinergic challenge experiment may be useful as a diagnostic test for this 
      condition.

TI  - Postoperative delirium is an independent risk factor for posttraumatic stress 
      disorder in the elderly patient: a prospective observational study.
PG  - 147-51
LID - 10.1097/EJA.0000000000000107 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may appear after hospitalisation 
      for surgery with general anaesthesia in elderly patients. Prevalence and risk 
      factors in this setting are unknown. Postoperative delirium could be a risk factor. 
      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to identify the prevalence of, and risk 
      factors for, PTSD 3 months after surgery with general anaesthesia in elderly 
      patients. DESIGN: A prospective, clinical observational study. SETTING: This study 
      was carried out between March 2009 and May 2010 in a German university hospital in 
      Berlin and was part of a larger study focusing on depth of anaesthesia. INCLUSION 
      CRITERIA: at least 60 years of age; noncardiac surgery with general anaesthesia. 
      EXCLUSION CRITERIA: impaired preoperative cognitive function [mini-mental state 
      examination (MMSE) score <24]; expected surgery time less than 1 h; nonproficiency 
      in the German language. INTERVENTIONS: None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Screening for 
      PTSD 3 months after surgery using the screening instrument Post-Traumatic Stress 
      Syndrome 14-Questions Inventory Score (PTSS-14). The following risk factors for PTSD 
      3 months after surgery were tested: age; American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      physical status; sex; duration of anaesthesia; postoperative delirium; PTSS-14 score 
      7 days after surgery; postoperative vomiting and nausea; postoperative pain; and 
      preoperative depression. STATISTICS: Univariate statistical analysis was performed 
      with Fisher's exact test and Spearman correlation. A backward logistic regression 
      was performed. RESULTS: A total of 559 out of 1277 patients were included. Sixty-six 
      patients (12%) were identified with PTSD 3 months after surgery. Seventy-seven 
      patients (14%) were identified with postoperative delirium. Independent associated 
      factors in the backward logistic regression were postoperative delirium (risk 
      factor) and preoperative depression (protective factor). CONCLUSION: The prevalence 
      of PTSD 3 months after surgery in elderly patients was high using the screening 
      instrument PTSS-14. Postoperative delirium is a risk factor for PTSD 3 months after 
      surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN Register: 36437985.

TI  - A Bacterial Toxin with Analgesic Properties: Hyperpolarization of DRG Neurons by 
      Mycolactone.
LID - 10.3390/toxins9070227 [doi]
LID - 227
AB  - Mycolactone, a polyketide molecule produced by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is the 
      etiological agent of Buruli ulcer. This lipid toxin is endowed with pleiotropic 
      effects, presents cytotoxic effects at high doses, and notably plays a pivotal role 
      in host response upon colonization by the bacillus. Most remarkably, mycolactone 
      displays intriguing analgesic capabilities: the toxin suppresses or alleviates the 
      pain of the skin lesions it inflicts. We demonstrated that the analgesic capability 
      of mycolactone was not attributable to nerve damage, but instead resulted from the 
      triggering of a cellular pathway targeting AT₂ receptors (angiotensin II type 2 
      receptors; AT₂R), and leading to potassium-dependent hyperpolarization. This 
      demonstration paves the way to new nature-inspired analgesic protocols. In this 
      direction, we assess here the hyperpolarizing properties of mycolactone on 
      nociceptive neurons. We developed a dedicated medium-throughput assay based on 
      membrane potential changes, and visualized by confocal microscopy of 
      bis-oxonol-loaded Dorsal Root Ganglion (DRG) neurons. We demonstrate that 
      mycolactone at non-cytotoxic doses triggers the hyperpolarization of DRG neurons 
      through AT₂R, with this action being not affected by known ligands of AT₂R. This 
      result points towards novel AT₂R-dependent signaling pathways in DRG neurons 
      underlying the analgesic effect of mycolactone, with the perspective for the 
      development of new types of nature-inspired analgesics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Investigating oral health-related quality of life's (OH-QoL) relationship 
      with cognitive state. BACKGROUND: Oral health affects OH-QoL and is poor in 
      institutionalised and cognitively impaired people. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a 
      cross-sectional study involving 215 institutionalised elderly (82.9 mean age), who 
      were interviewed, examined and cognitively screened using the Pfeiffer test. 
      RESULTS: Mean GOHAI score was 53.1; only 43.7% of the participants reported having a 
      good OH-QoL. Needing help with dressing or washing (OR 2.14; p = 0.004), having one 
      to nine teeth (OR 4.65; p ≥ 0.001), eight or less occluding pairs (OR 2.74; p = 
      0.002), one to three caries (OR 1.85; p = 0.005) and being cognitive impaired (OR 
      0.54; p = 0.034) were significantly associated with altered OH-QoL in bi-variate 
      analysis. Being edentulous (OR 3.18; p = 0.0046), having 1-9 teeth (OR 2.62; p = 
      0.056) and presenting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (OR 0.32; p = 0.016) appeared 
      as predictive variables in logistic regression for having an altered OH-QoL. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Participants having MCI had significantly better GOHAI score than 
      cognitively normal residents. Performing cognitive screening parallel to applying 
      any OH-QoL instrument would make the results more reliable and would benefit 
      cognitively impaired people.

TI  - Geriatric assessment factors are associated with mortality after hospitalization in 
      older adults with cancer.
PG  - 4807-13
LID - 10.1007/s00520-016-3334-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Survival in older adults with cancer varies given differences in functional 
      status, comorbidities, and nutrition. Prediction of factors associated with 
      mortality, especially in hospitalized patients, allows physicians to better inform 
      their patients about prognosis during treatment decisions. Our objective was to 
      analyze factors associated with survival in older adults with cancer following 
      hospitalization. METHODS: Through a retrospective cohort study, we reviewed 803 
      patients who were admitted to Barnes-Jewish Hospital's Oncology Acute Care of Elders 
      (OACE) unit from 2000 to 2008. Data collected included geriatric assessments from 
      OACE screening questionnaires as well as demographic and medical history data from 
      chart review. The primary end point was time from index admission to death. The Cox 
      proportional hazard modeling was performed. RESULTS: The median age was 72.5 years 
      old. Geriatric syndromes and functional impairment were common. Half of the patients 
      (50.4 %) were dependent in one or more activities of daily living (ADLs), and 74 % 
      were dependent in at least one instrumental activity of daily living (IADLs). On 
      multivariate analysis, the following factors were significantly associated with 
      worse overall survival: male gender; a total score <20 on Lawton's IADL assessment; 
      reason for admission being cardiac, pulmonary, neurologic, inadequate pain control, 
      or failure to thrive; cancer type being thoracic, hepatobiliary, or genitourinary; 
      readmission within 30 days; receiving cancer treatment with palliative rather than 
      curative intent; cognitive impairment; and discharge with hospice services. 
      CONCLUSIONS: In older adults with cancer, certain geriatric parameters are 
      associated with shorter survival after hospitalization. Assessment of functional 
      status, necessity for readmission, and cognitive impairment may provide prognostic 
      information so that oncologists and their patients make more informed, 
      individualized decisions.

TI  - Loneliness, loss, and social support among cognitively intact older people with 
      cancer, living in nursing homes--a mixed-methods study.
PG  - 1529-36
LID - 10.2147/CIA.S88404 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Loneliness is a significant psychosocial effect following a cancer 
      diagnosis and may prevent people from engaging in social activities, thus creating 
      difficulties in interpersonal relationships. This study investigated loneliness and 
      social support among cognitively intact nursing home residents with cancer by using 
      a quantitatively driven mixed-methods design with sequential supplementary 
      qualitative components. METHODS: The quantitative component consisted of 
      face-to-face interviews of 60 nursing home residents (≥65 years) using the one-item 
      Loneliness Scale and the Social Provisions Scale. The supplementary psychosocial 
      component consisted of qualitative research interviews about experiences related to 
      loneliness with nine respondents. RESULTS: The quantitative results indicated that 
      reassurance of worth was associated with loneliness. The experience of loneliness 
      was identified by the following: loneliness that was dominated by a feeling of inner 
      pain, feeling of loss, and feeling small. Loneliness was alleviated by the 
      following: being engaged in activities, being in contact with other people, and 
      occupying oneself. CONCLUSION: Enhancing the lives of nursing home residents with 
      cancer requires attending to the residents' experience of loneliness and social 
      relationships in a targeted and individualized manner. This might require screening 
      all nursing home residents for early detection of loneliness. Revealing factors that 
      may contribute to or reduce loneliness improves the ability to enhance people's 
      lives.

TI  - A multicenter study comparing two numerical versions of the Edmonton Symptom 
      Assessment System in palliative care patients.
PG  - 456-68
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2010.04.020 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) is a widely used, self-report 
      symptom intensity tool for assessing nine common symptoms in palliative care, with 
      ratings ranging from 0 (none, best) to 10 (worst). Based on a "think-aloud" study of 
      20 advanced cancer patients, the ESAS was revised (ESAS-r). OBJECTIVES: To compare 
      the consistency of patients' symptom ratings and obtain patient perspectives 
      regarding ease of understanding and completion between the ESAS and ESAS-r. METHODS: 
      Cognitively intact patients (n=160) were recruited from eight palliative care sites 
      in Canada and Switzerland, using cross-sectional sampling (20 per site). Consenting 
      patients completed the ESAS, ESAS-r, and a structured interview. Intraclass 
      correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated to assess rating consistency. 
      RESULTS: In total, 1046 patients were screened. One hundred sixty were enrolled and 
      evaluable (female 51%, median age 61 [range 34-92], lung cancer 26%, 
      gastrointestinal cancer 22%). Mean ESAS scores ranged from 1.2 (nausea, standard 
      deviation [SD] 2.1) to 4.3 (appetite, SD 3.3). ICCs ranged from 0.65 to 0.83, with 
      lowest scores (<0.8) for drowsiness, appetite, and well-being. Although most 
      patients rated both versions as very easy or easy to understand and complete, the 
      ESAS-r was significantly easier to understand than the ESAS (P=0.008). 
      Significantly, more patients preferred the ESAS-r (39%) than the ESAS (14%, P<0.001) 
      because of its definitions, clarity, and format. CONCLUSION: The ESAS-r retains core 
      elements of the ESAS, with improved interpretation and clarity of symptom intensity 
      assessment. It represents the next generation of ESAS development, with further 
      validation recommended for drowsiness, appetite, and well-being.

TI  - For veterans with mild traumatic brain injury, improved posttraumatic stress 
      disorder severity and sleep correlated with symptomatic improvement.
PG  - 1305-20
AB  - This was an observational study of a cohort of 63 Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation 
      Enduring Freedom veterans with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) associated with an 
      explosion. They had headaches, residual neurological deficits (NDs) on neurological 
      examination, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and were seen on average 2.5 
      years after their last mTBI. We treated them with sleep hygiene counseling and oral 
      prazosin. We monitored headache severity, daytime sleepiness using the Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale, cognitive performance using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 
      test, and the presence of NDs. We quantitatively measured olfaction and assessed 
      PTSD severity using the PTSD Checklist-Military Version. Nine weeks after starting 
      sleep counseling and bedtime prazosin, the veterans' headache severity decreased, 
      cognitive function as assayed with a brief screening tool improved, and daytime 
      sleepiness diminished. Six months after completing treatment, the veterans 
      demonstrated additional improvement in headache severity and daytime sleepiness and 
      their improvements in cognitive function persisted. There were no changes in the 
      prevalence of NDs or olfaction scores. Clinical improvements correlated with reduced 
      PTSD severity and daytime sleepiness. The data suggested that reduced clinical 
      manifestations following mTBI correlated with PTSD severity and improvement in 
      sleep, but not the presence of NDs or olfaction impairment.

TI  - Frailty and Quality of Life in Older Adults with Metabolic Syndrome - Findings from 
      the Healthy Older People Everyday (HOPE) Study.
PG  - 637-644
LID - 10.1007/s12603-021-1609-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) and frailty are both associated with increased 
      morbidity and mortality. Frailty is associated with reduced quality of life (QoL) 
      but association of QoL with MetS have produced mixed results suggesting that other 
      factors such as disease burden, obesity and depression may have a more significant 
      influence. We aim to investigate the demographics of frail participants with MetS, 
      and relationship between frailty and QoL in MetS. METHODS: Cross-sectional 
      population study involving 292 older adults ≥ 65 years with MetS. MetS was defined 
      using the Modified ATP III for Asians which requires the presence of 3 or more of 
      the following 5 components 1) waist circumference ≥ 90cm for males or ≥ 80cm for 
      females, 2) TG ≥ 150mg/dL, 3) HDLc < 40mg/dL in males or < 50mg/dL in females, 4) 
      blood pressure ≥ 130/85mmHg or use of anti-hypertensive medication, and 5) fasting 
      plasma glucose ≥ 100mg/dL or use of pharmacological treatment for diabetes mellitus. 
      Data were collected on demographics, frailty (FRAIL), QoL (Euroqol-5D), perceived 
      health, functional status, cognition, Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG), and hand-grip strength 
      (HGS). RESULTS: 40.4% of the participants were pre-frail (MetSprefrail) and 7.2% 
      were frail (MetSfrail). MetSfrail were significantly older, had lower education 
      level, higher polypharmacy burden and higher prevalence of diabetes. The prevalence 
      of at least 1 activity of daily living impairment was 4 times higher, and depression 
      9 times higher than their robust counterparts. MetSfrail also had longer TUG, higher 
      prevalence of poor grip strength and poor perceived health. After adjusting for age, 
      gender and education, MetSfrail was significantly associated with much higher odds 
      of EQ-5D moderate to extreme problems with mobility (Odds Ratio (OR) =10.99, CI 
      2.62-46.14), usual activities (OR=37.82, CI 3.77-379.04) and pain (OR=10.79, CI 
      3.18-36.62). EQ-5D Index Value and Perceived Health improved by 0.1 (Mean Difference 
      (MD) =0.07, CI 0.04-0.10) and 6.0 (MD=6.01, CI 3.29-8.73) respectively as frailty 
      status improved. CONCLUSION: Frailty in MetS is associated with depression, 
      polypharmacy, greater functional impairment, poorer QoL and perceived health. 
      Frailty screening and personalized management is crucial in MetS as frailty may be a 
      mediator for negative outcomes in MetS, and frailty may be reversible.

TI  - A screening programme on chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy among Dutch 
      painters.
PG  - 727-33
LID - 10.1016/j.neuro.2012.05.015 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to organic solvents may lead to chronic solvent 
      induced encephalopathy (CSE) in painters. In combination with reduction of exposure, 
      a workers' health surveillance programme was developed, resulting in a three-stage 
      CSE screening procedure for early neurobehavioural changes possibly predicting 
      chronic health effects. The screening consists of a questionnaire (Neurosymptom 
      Screening Checklist 60, NSC-60), computerised neurobehavioural functioning testing 
      (Neurobehavioural Evaluation System; NES2) and multidisciplinary differential 
      diagnostic evaluation by experts (called 'Solvent Team'). Results from the screening 
      were compared with the results of the 'care as usual' (CAU), in which symptomatic 
      patients were referred directly to the Solvent Team by occupational physicians, 
      general practitioners or medical specialists. Parallel to the screening programme, a 
      legal ban on indoor use of solvent-based paints resulted in lower exposure to 
      solvents. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the usefulness of the NSC-60 questionnaire as a 
      screening tool for CSE among painters and to investigate the course of the number of 
      CSE cases over the years as a potential consequence of improved prevention and 
      control. RESULTS: From 1998 to 2004, more than 40,000 painters were invited to 
      participate in a health surveillance programme including a periodical occupational 
      health examination (PHE) and 50% did participate. Four percent (N=794) of these had 
      a positive score on the NSC-60. The Solvent Team assessed 101 of these for CSE, 
      which resulted in 27 CSE cases diagnosed. CAU during the same period of the 
      surveillance (1998-2004) yielded 619 painters and 75 of these had the diagnosis CSE. 
      After 2002 the number of CSE diagnosed cases dropped considerably and in 2004 only 
      one case of CSE could be diagnosed. The substantially lower prevalence of CSE 
      diagnosed cases in painters after 2002 might partly be explained as a result of a 
      successful participation in the screening procedure of most prevalent CSE cases 
      during the years 1998-2002. A second reason for the reduction of new diagnosed cases 
      of CSE can be the effectiveness of the ban on indoor use of solvent-based paints 
      resulting in lower exposure levels at work. CONCLUSION: The screening procedure is 
      useful to screen for CSE among people taking part in the PHE programme. Control of 
      CSE can be achieved by an integrated preventive approach with reduction of exposure 
      and screening on early health effects.

TI  - Health status correlates of malnutrition in the polish elderly population - Results 
      of the Polsenior Study.
PG  - 4565-4573
LID - 11690 [pii]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to analyze health-related factors associated 
      with poor nutritional status (PNS) of a representative group of Polish older people, 
      based on data from the PolSenior project (the first nation-wide study of Polish 
      senior citizens). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Nutritional status was assessed in 3751 
      community-dwelling older people (1770 females, mean age: 77.4±8.0 years) using the 
      Mini Nutritional Assessment - Short Form. Elements of comprehensive geriatric 
      assessment (cognitive and mood screening), selected medical data were analyzed in 
      relation to the nutritional status. These were: the number of medications, the 
      number of chronic diseases, selected diseases potentially related to malnutrition 
      (anaemia, stroke, peptic ulcer, Parkinson's disease, cancer - past or present), 
      total edentulism, use of dentures, and chronic pain. RESULTS: PNS was observed in 
      44.2% of participants. Female sex [OR 1.72, 95% Cl (1.45-2.04)], advanced age [OR 
      2.16 (1.80-2.58)], symptoms of depression [OR 11.52 (9.24-14.38)], cognitive 
      impairment [OR 1.52 (1.20-1.93], multimorbidity [OR 1.27 (1.04-1.57)], anaemia [OR 
      1.80 (1.41-2.29)] and total edentulism [OR 1.26 (1.06-1.49)] were independently 
      correlated with PNS. CONCLUSIONS: PNS in Polish elderly population is strongly 
      related to the occurrence of symptoms of depression. People in advanced age with 
      symptoms of depression, cognitive impairment, multimorbidity, anaemia and total 
      edentulism should be screened and monitored for early symptoms of malnutrition.

TI  - The Use of the MyoDK for Mechanical Pressure in the Treatment of Chronic Lateral 
      Epicondylalgia: A Pilot Study.
PG  - YC05-8
LID - 10.7860/JCDR/2015/13615.6673 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chronic Lateral Epicondylalgia (CLE) is potentially associated with a 
      significant reduction of the patient's quality of life; its treatment by manual Deep 
      Transverse Friction (DTF), although widely accepted, lacks standardization. The 
      purpose of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of the MyoDK device, which allows 
      deep transverse pressure (DTP) monitoring, for treatment of CLE. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: This is a single centre observational study for treatment of CLE by the 
      MyoDK device. In a given year, all patients who appeared at our institution with a 
      diagnostic of CLE were screened for possible inclusion. Exclusion criteria were: 
      confounding factors on pain and function of the upper limb, cognitive impairment, 
      inability or unwilling to give informed consent or to comply with treatment 
      protocol. Our primary outcome measure was the pain reduction measured by the VAS 
      pain scale (VAS) at 6 weeks. Our intervention consisted in applying a pressure from 
      0.5 to 10kg/100mm(2) for 20 minutes, once a week for 6 weeks, using the MyoDK 
      device. RESULTS: Thirty patients were screened. Two were excluded for incomplete 
      protocol, remaining 28 for analysis. Mean age was 47.3, 23 were male (82.1%), 24 
      were affected on their dominant side (85.7%). We had a significant reduction in VAS 
      pain score at 12 weeks (80.8 vs 13.0; p<0.01). There were no side effects reported. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study showed the safety of the use of a standard protocol using the 
      MyoDK device for treatment of CLE. We believe that further controlled studies will 
      establish the MyoDK as a reliable option for treatment of CLE.

TI  - Screening instruments for depression in advanced cancer patients: what do we 
      actually measure?
PG  - 467-75
LID - 10.1111/papr.12012 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in a palliative care trajectory frequently suffer from 
      depression. To distinguish depression from normal sadness, the use of screening 
      instruments could facilitate the diagnostic process. However, in palliative care, 
      screening instruments may not discern physical symptom burden from psychological 
      distress, due to the high number of physical symptoms in palliative patients. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore physical symptom burden and 
      psychological distress in patients with advanced cancer in relation to scores on 
      screening instruments for depression. METHODS: Patients with advanced cancer were 
      asked to fill out the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Beck Depression Inventory 
      Primary Care (BDI-PC), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and Memorial 
      Symptom Assessment Scale Short Form (MSAS-SF). The relationship between scores on 
      screening tools for depression and different physical symptom clusters was explored. 
      RESULTS: In the sample of 65 patients, screening instruments for depression 
      correlated highly with different somatic symptom clusters. The BDI-II cognitive 
      subscale was the only scale that was not significantly correlated with any of the 
      somatic symptom clusters. CONCLUSION: Screening tools for the detection of 
      depression in patients with advanced cancer may not provide an accurate evaluation 
      of depression. These tools seem to measure physical symptom burden as well, 
      especially when patients suffer from symptoms of the clusters 
      fatigue/anorexia/cachexia, neuropsychology, debility, or pain. In this study, the 
      BDI-II cognitive subscale seems to differentiate best from somatic symptom burden.

AB  - Nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) of Parkinson's disease (PD) are common, but they are often 
      underrecognized in clinical practice, because of the lack of spontaneous complaints 
      by the patients, and partly because of the absence of systematic questioning by the 
      consulting physician. However, valid specific instruments for identification and 
      assessment of these symptoms are available in 2012. The administration of the 
      self-completed screening tool, NMSQuest, associated with questioning during the 
      consultation, improves the diagnosis of NMSs. NMSs play a large role in degradation 
      of quality of life. More relevant NMSs are described in this review, mood disorders, 
      impulse control disorders, cognitive deficits, hallucinations, pain, sleep 
      disorders, and dysautonomia.

TI  - [Methohexital for analgosedation of ventilated intensive care patients : prospective 
      nonrandomized single center observational study on incidence of delirium].
PG  - 488-95
LID - 10.1007/s00101-014-2317-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
      Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR) as a potentially reversible 
      disturbance of consciousness and a change of cognition caused by a medical 
      condition, drug intoxication, or medication side effect. Delirium affects up to 80 % 
      of intensive care unit (ICU) patients and is associated with increased morbidity and 
      mortality. One risk factor for development of delirium in ventilated intensive care 
      unit patients is sedation. The German S3 guidelines on "Analgesie, Sedierung und 
      Delirmanagement in der Intensivmedizin" (analgesia, sedation and delirium management 
      in intensive care medicine) of the DGAI (German Society for Anesthesiology and 
      Intensive Care Medicine) and the DIVI (German Interdisciplinary Association for 
      Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine) recommend midazolam and propofol for 
      sedation, although both drugs are associated with a high incidence of delirium. AIM: 
      Within the framework of this study the question arose whether the barbiturate 
      methohexital could be associated with a lower incidence of delirium in comparison to 
      midazolam or propofol in analgosedated and ventilated ICU patients. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: This was a prospective nonrandomized observational cohort study in a mixed 
      medical surgical intensive care unit. Patients ventilated within 72 h after 
      admittance were consecutively allocated to either propofol/remifentanil versus 
      methohexital/remifentanil (expected ventilation duration ≤ 7 days) or 
      midazolam/fentanyl versus methohexital/fentanyl (expected ventilation duration > 7 
      days) by the attending senior consultant anesthetist at the time of admission and/or 
      intubation. Primary endpoint was delirium at any time during the ICU stay. Delirium 
      was checked every 8 h by ICU nurses using the intensive care delirium screening 
      checklist (ICDSC), with delirium defined as ICDSC ≥ 4 points. Before evaluation of 
      the ICDSC the Richmond agitation sedation scale (RASS) score and the visual analogue 
      scale for pain (VAS target ≤ 4) were measured. To assure reliable evaluation of the 
      ICDSC, the RASS score of the patient at the time of evaluation had to be ≥ - 2. 
      Assuming an incidence of delirium in the midazolam group of 70 % and in the 
      methohexital group of 35 %, 16 patients were needed each in the midazolam/fentanyl 
      and the methohexital/fentanyl cohorts (p = 0.05, β = 0.1). Assuming an incidence of 
      delirium in the propofol group of 50 % and in the methohexital group again of 35 %, 
      94 patients were needed in the propofol/remifentanil and methohexital/remifentanil 
      groups, respectively (p = 0.05, β = 0.1). RESULTS: A total of 222 patients were 
      evaluated, 34 in the methohexital vs. midazolam group and 188 in the methohexital 
      vs. propofol group. Out of 16 patients sedated with midazolam, 15 developed delirium 
      (94 %) in contrast to only 5 out of 18 patients sedated with methohexital (28 %). 
      Thus compared to midazolam the sedation with methohexital reduced the incidence of 
      delirium by 66 % (p < 0.001) corresponding to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 1.5. 
      Out of 94 patients in the propofol/remifentanil group, 64 developed delirium (68 %) 
      in contrast to only 23 out of 94 in the methohexital/remifentanil group (24 %). Thus 
      compared to propofol the sedation with methohexital reduced the incidence of 
      delirium by 44 % (p < 0.001), corresponding to an NNT of 2.5. CONCLUSION: Sedation 
      with methohexital compared to midazolam or propofol reduced the incidence of 
      delirium by more than 50 % in ventilated ICU patients.

TI  - MoCA vs. MMSE of Fibromyalgia Patients: The Possible Role of Dual-Task Tests in 
      Detecting Cognitive Impairment.
LID - 10.3390/jcm10010125 [doi]
LID - 125
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a syndrome that is characterized by widespread pain; fatigue; 
      stiffness; reduced physical fitness; sleep disturbances; psychological symptoms, 
      such as anxiety and depression; and deficits in cognitive functions, such as 
      attention, executive function, and verbal memory deficits. It is important to 
      analyze the potentially different performance on the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE) and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test in patients with 
      fibromyalgia as well as examine the relationship of that performance with physical 
      and cognitive performance. A total of 36 women with fibromyalgia participated in the 
      study. Participants completed the MoCA test, the MMSE, and the TUG physical fitness 
      test under dual-task conditions. The results obtained on cognitive tests were 28.19 
      (1.74) on the MMSE and 25.17 (2.79) on the MoCA. The participants' performance on 
      cognitive tests was significantly related to the results of the TUG dual-task test. 
      In this way, cognitive performance on a dual-task test can be used to support the 
      diagnosis of cognitive impairment in patients with fibromyalgia. The MoCA test may 
      be a more sensitive cognitive screening tool than the MMSE for patients with 
      fibromyalgia.

TI  - Relevant domains and outcome measurement instruments in Neuropsychiatric Systemic 
      Lupus Erythematosus: a systematic literature review.
LID - keab324 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/rheumatology/keab324 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although neuropsychiatric involvement in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
      (NPSLE) is one of the most complex and troubling manifestations of the disease, 
      validated outcome instruments to be used as sensitive endpoints in controlled 
      clinical trials are lacking. We set out a systematic literature review (SLR) to 
      identify outcome measurement instruments and domains used to assess NPSLE. METHODS: 
      The Preferred Reporting Items for systematic reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) 
      guidelines were used. Articles available in English (1967-2020), listed in PubMed, 
      EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and EULAR outcome measures library were screened. 
      All domains and outcome measurement instruments were characterized according to the 
      OMERACT Filter 2.1, considering core areas (manifestations/abnormalities, life 
      impact, death/lifespan, societal/resource use) and contextual factors. RESULTS: Of 
      3,392 abstracts evaluated, 83 studies were included in the SLR (15,974 patients, 
      females 89.9%). Eligible studies included domains and instruments pertinent to all 
      core areas defined by OMERACT, except for "societal/resource use". The most common 
      core areas were "manifestations/abnormalities", covering 10 domains pertinent to 
      laboratory and instrumental markers, indexes and neuropsychiatric dimension 
      (cognitive, neurologic and psychiatric field), and "life impact", covering 7 domains 
      related to physical function (from both the perspective of the patient and the 
      physician), pain and quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed great 
      heterogeneity in the instruments derived from populations with NPSLE and none of 
      these had high-quality evidence. This supports the need to develop and further 
      validate a core domain set and outcome measurement instruments to promote clinical 
      research in this field, enhancing comparability across studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults experiencing homelessness have a high burden of sleep 
      disturbance, which may be reduced by accessing permanent supportive housing. 
      OBJECTIVES: To assess sleep disturbances and their correlates, including 
      demographics, activity level, health status, age-related health issues (eg, 
      functionality and cognitive impairment), substance use, and homelessness history in 
      a sample of permanent supportive housing (PSH) tenants. RESEARCH DESIGN: 
      Cross-sectional survey design. SUBJECTS: A total of 237 formerly homeless adults 
      between 45 and 80 years old. MEASURES: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
      Information System (PROMIS) Sleep Disturbance short form was used to measure sleep 
      disturbance. RESULTS: Twenty-eight percent of our sample had PROMIS scores 
      indicative of a moderate or severe sleep disturbance. Functional impairment, pain, 
      and mental health comorbidities were associated with increased sleep disturbance in 
      multivariable linear regression analyses. The number of years a person experienced 
      homelessness was inversely associated with sleep disturbance. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study supports the need to screen for sleep disturbances among PSH tenants. The 
      findings suggest that supportive services in PSH may need to include integrated 
      physical and behavioral health care, pain management, and interventions designed to 
      address activities of daily livings to improve tenant sleep. They also suggest that 
      improved sleep may help reduce PSH tenant pain, impairment, and mental health 
      symptoms among PSH tenants.

TI  - Prognosis of Symptomatic Pseudarthrosis Observed at 1 Year After Lateral Lumbar 
      Interbody Fusion.
LID - 10.1097/BRS.0000000000003980 [doi]
AB  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prognosis of 
      symptomatic pseudarthrosis observed at 1 year after lateral lumbar interbody fusion 
      (LLIF) surgery and to analyze the risk factors for persistent pseudarthrosis for 
      2 years postoperatively. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few papers have evaluated the 
      prognosis of symptomatic pseudarthrosis following LLIF surgery. METHODS: One hundred 
      fifty-two patients with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were screened. Fusion status 
      was assessed at 1 year postoperatively, and unfused segments were re-evaluated at 
      2 years postoperatively. Dynamic X-rays and CT images were acquired to evaluate the 
      fusion status. Demographic data were evaluated to identify the risk factors 
      associated with persistent pseudarthrosis. Clinical outcomes, including the visual 
      analog scale (VAS) for back/leg pain and the Oswestry disability index (ODI), were 
      evaluated preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. RESULTS: Symptomatic 
      pseudarthrosis was detected in 42 patients at 1 year postoperatively. Among them, 23 
      patients (54.8%) exhibited solid bony fusion 2 years postoperatively without further 
      intervention. Fourteen patients (33.3%) showed asymptomatic pseudarthrosis, and the 
      remaining 5 patients (11.9%) showed symptomatic pseudarthrosis. Multivariable 
      analysis showed that diabetes (adjusted OR: 2.817, p = 0.007), smoking (adjusted OR: 
      6.497, p = 0.008), and fusion at more than 3 levels (adjusted OR: 2.525, p = 0.031) 
      were risk factors for persistent pseudarthrosis. Improvements in the VAS scores for 
      back pain and ODI scores were significantly lower in the persistent pseudarthrosis 
      group than in the final solid fusion group at 2 years postoperatively. CONCLUSION: 
      It is not necessary to intervene for all patients in whom symptomatic pseudarthrosis 
      is detected at 1 year postoperatively because only 11.9% of them will show 
      persistent symptomatic pseudarthrosis. However, early revision surgery should be 
      considered when severe symptomatic pseudarthrosis associated with diabetes, smoking, 
      and fusion at more than 3 levels is present.Level of Evidence: 4.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades the respiratory system, 
      causing acute and sometimes severe pulmonary symptoms, but turned out to also act 
      multisystematically with substantial impact on the brain. A growing number of 
      studies suggests a diverse spectrum of neurological manifestations. To investigate 
      the spectrum of symptoms, we here describe the neurological manifestations and 
      complications of patients with proven SARS-CoV-2 infection who have been 
      hospitalized at the RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Germany. METHODS: Between March 
      and September 2020, we evaluated common symptoms, clinical characteristics, 
      laboratory (including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis), radiological, and 
      electroencephalography (EEG) data from 53 patients admitted with a positive 
      SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We used the Montreal Cognitive 
      Assessment Test (MoCA) to screen for cognitive impairment, when feasible. We 
      compared critically ill and non-critically ill patients categorized according to the 
      presence of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). RESULTS: Major clinical 
      neurological features of hospitalized COVID-19 patients were coordination deficits 
      (74%), cognitive impairment (61.5%), paresis (47%), abnormal reflex status (45%), 
      sensory abnormalities (45%), general muscle weakness and pain (32%), hyposmia (26%), 
      and headache (21%). Patients with ARDS were more severely affected than non-ADRS 
      patients. 29.6% of patients with ARDS presented with subarachnoid bleedings, and 
      11.1% showed ischemic stroke associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Cognitive 
      deficits mainly affected executive functions, attention, language, and delayed 
      memory recall. We obtained cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture in nine of 
      the 53 patients, none of which had a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR. CONCLUSIONS: In line 
      with previous findings, our results provide evidence for a range of 
      SARS-CoV-2-associated neurological manifestations. 26% of patients reported 
      hyposmia, emphasizing the neuro-invasive potential of SARS-CoV-2, which can enter 
      the olfactory bulb. It can therefore be speculated that neurological manifestations 
      may be caused by direct invasion of the virus in the CNS; however, PCR did not 
      reveal positive intrathecal SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we hypothesize it is more likely 
      that the para-infectious severe pro-inflammatory impact of COVID-19 is responsible 
      for the neurological deficits including cognitive impairment. Future studies with 
      comprehensive longitudinal assessment of neurological deficits are required to 
      determine potential long-term complications of COVID-19.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: When cognitive impairment precludes patients' report of symptoms, it 
      becomes necessary to use other means. The purpose of our study was to evaluate the 
      validity of the method currently in use on our service. METHOD: Two members of the 
      team simultaneously assessed the patient and independently recorded whether the 
      patient showed signs of discomfort, and a third questioned patients with cognitive 
      failure who maintained some ability to respond if something was bothering them. 
      RESULTS: Some 200 assessments were made of 116 patients. The kappa coefficient of 
      agreement was 0.615. The sensitivity was 17% and specificity 99%. The positive 
      predictive value was 88%, and the negative predictive value was 73%. SIGNIFICANCE OF 
      RESULTS: Due to the low sensitivity of this method, it cannot be recommended as a 
      screening tool.

AB  - SPG8 is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary spastic paraplegia (AD-HSP), with only 
      six SPG8 families described so far. Our purpose was to screen for KIAA0196 (SPG8) 
      mutations in AD-HSP patients and to investigate their phenotype. Extensive family 
      investigation was performed after positive KIAA0196 mutation analysis, which was 
      part of an on-going mutation screening effort in AD-HSP patients. A novel pathogenic 
      KIAA0196 mutation p.(Gly696Ala) was identified in two AD-HSP patients, who 
      subsequently were shown to belong to a single large Dutch pedigree with more than 10 
      affected family members. The phenotype consisted of a pure HSP with ages at onset 
      between 20 and 60 years, distally reduced vibration sense in the legs in all, and 
      urinary urgency in seven out of 10 patients. Frequent features were exercise- or 
      emotion-induced increase of spasticity and gait problems and chronic nonspecific 
      lower back and joint pains. We have identified a fourth pathogenic KIAA0196 mutation 
      in a Dutch HSP-family, the seventh family worldwide, with a less severe clinical 
      course than described before.

TI  - An Integrated Bioinformatics Approach for Identifying Genetic Markers that Predict 
      Cerebrospinal Fluid Biomarker p-tau181/Aβ1-42 Ratio in ApoE4-Negative Mild Cognitive 
      Impairment Patients.
PG  - 1061-76

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, with no 
      disease-modifying treatment yet available. Early detection of patients at risk of 
      developing AD is of central importance. Blood-based genetic signatures can serve as 
      early detection and as population-based screening tools. In this study, we aimed to 
      identify genetic markers and gene signatures associated with cerebrospinal fluid 
      (CSF) biomarkers levels of t-tau, p-tau181, and with the two ratios t-tau/Aβ1-42 and 
      p-tau181/Aβ1-42 in the context of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
      to AD, and to identify a panel of genetic markers that can predict CSF biomarker 
      p-tau181/Aβ1-42 ratio with consideration of APOE ε4 stratification. We analyzed 
      genome-wide the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset with up to 48 
      months follow-up. In the first part of the analysis, the main effect of single 
      nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed for 
      each of the four CSF biomarkers. In the second part of the analysis, we performed an 
      integrated analysis of genome-wide association study results with pathway enrichment 
      analysis, predictive modeling and network analysis in the subgroup of ApoE4-negative 
      subjects. We identified a panel of five SNPs, rs6766238, rs1143960, rs1249963, 
      rs11975968, and rs4836493, that are predictive for p-tau181/Aβ1-42 ratio (high/low) 
      with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 70% (AUC 0.74). These results suggest 
      that a panel of SNPs is a potential prognostic biomarker in ApoE4-negative MCI 
      patients.

TI  - Duration of Neurocognitive Impairment With Medical Cannabis Use: A Scoping Review.
PG  - 638962

AB  - While the recreational use of cannabis has well-established dose-dependent effects 
      on neurocognitive and psychomotor functioning, there is little consensus on the 
      degree and duration of impairment typically seen with medical marijuana use. 
      Compared to recreational cannabis users, medical cannabis patients have distinct 
      characteristics that may modify the presence and extent of impairment. The goal of 
      this review was to determine the duration of acute neurocognitive impairment 
      associated with medical cannabis use, and to identify differences between medical 
      cannabis patients and recreational users. These findings are used to gain insight on 
      how medical professionals can best advise medical cannabis patients with regards to 
      automobile driving or safety-sensitive tasks at work. A systematic electronic search 
      for English language randomized controlled trials (RCTs), clinical trials and 
      systematic reviews (in order to capture any potentially missed RCTs) between 2000 
      and 2019 was conducted through Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE electronic databases using 
      MeSH terms. Articles were limited to medical cannabis patients using cannabis for 
      chronic non-cancer pain or spasticity. After screening titles and abstracts, 37 
      relevant studies were subjected to full-text review. Overall, seven controlled 
      trials met the inclusion/exclusion criteria and were included in the qualitative 
      synthesis: six RCTs and one observational clinical trial. Neurocognitive testing 
      varied significantly between all studies, including the specific tests administered 
      and the timing of assessments post-cannabis consumption. In general, cognitive 
      performance declined mostly in a THC dose-dependent manner, with steady resolution 
      of impairment in the hours following THC administration. Doses of THC were lower 
      than those typically reported in recreational cannabis studies. In all the studies, 
      there was no difference between any of the THC groups and placebo on any 
      neurocognitive measure after 4 h of recovery. Variability in the dose-dependent 
      relationship raises the consideration that there are other important factors 
      contributing to the duration of neurocognitive impairment besides the dose of THC 
      ingested. These modifiable and non-modifiable factors are individually discussed.

TI  - First neuropathological description of a patient with Parkinson's disease and LRRK2 
      p.N1437H mutation.
PG  - 332-8
LID - 10.1016/j.parkreldis.2011.11.019 [doi]
AB  - The c.4309A>C mutation in the LRRK2 gene (LRRK2 p.N1437H) has recently been reported 
      as the seventh pathogenic LRRK2 mutation causing monogenic Parkinson's disease (PD). 
      So far, only two families worldwide have been identified with this mutation. By 
      screening DNA from seven brains of PD patients, we found one individual with 
      seemingly sporadic PD and LRRK2 p.N1437H mutation. Clinically, the patient had 
      levodopa-responsive PD with tremor, and developed severe motor fluctuations during a 
      disease duration of 19 years. There was severe and painful ON-dystonia, and severe 
      depression with suicidal thoughts during OFF. In the advanced stage, cognition was 
      slow during motor OFF, but there was no noticeable cognitive decline. There were no 
      signs of autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Bilateral deep brain stimulation of 
      the subthalamic nucleus had unsatisfactory results on motor symptoms. The patient 
      committed suicide. Neuropathological examination revealed marked cell loss and 
      moderate alpha-synuclein positive Lewy body pathology in the brainstem. There was 
      sparse Lewy pathology in the cortex. A striking finding was very pronounced 
      ubiquitin-positive pathology in the brainstem, temporolimbic regions and neocortex. 
      Ubiquitin positivity was most pronounced in the white matter, and was out of 
      proportion to the comparatively weaker alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. 
      Immunostaining for tau was mildly positive, revealing non-specific changes, but 
      staining for TDP-43 and FUS was entirely negative. The distribution and shape of 
      ubiquitin-positive lesions in this patient differed from the few previously 
      described patients with LRRK2 mutations and ubiquitin pathology, and the 
      ubiquitinated protein substrate remains undefined.

TI  - The optimal sequence and selection of screening test items to predict fall risk in 
      older disabled women: the Women's Health and Aging Study.
PG  - 1082-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Falls are a major cause of disability, dependence, and death in older 
      people. Brief screening algorithms may be helpful in identifying risk and leading to 
      more detailed assessment. Our aim was to determine the most effective sequence of 
      falls screening test items from a wide selection of recommended items including 
      self-report and performance tests, and to compare performance with other published 
      guidelines. METHODS: Data were from a prospective, age-stratified, cohort study. 
      Participants were 1002 community-dwelling women aged 65 years old or older, 
      experiencing at least some mild disability. Assessments of fall risk factors were 
      conducted in participants' homes. Fall outcomes were collected at 6 monthly 
      intervals. Algorithms were built for prediction of any fall over a 12-month period 
      using tree classification with cross-set validation. RESULTS: Algorithms using 
      performance tests provided the best prediction of fall events, and achieved moderate 
      to strong performance when compared to commonly accepted benchmarks. The items 
      selected by the best performing algorithm were the number of falls in the last year 
      and, in selected subpopulations, frequency of difficulty balancing while walking, a 
      4 m walking speed test, body mass index, and a test of knee extensor strength. The 
      algorithm performed better than that from the American Geriatric Society/British 
      Geriatric Society/American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and other guidance, 
      although these findings should be treated with caution. CONCLUSIONS: Suggestions are 
      made on the type, number, and sequence of tests that could be used to maximize 
      estimation of the probability of falling in older disabled women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sex differences in incidence and/or presentation of schizophrenia (SCZ), 
      major depressive disorder (MDD), and bipolar disorder (BIP) are pervasive. Previous 
      evidence for shared genetic risk and sex differences in brain abnormalities across 
      disorders suggest possible shared sex-dependent genetic risk. METHODS: We conducted 
      the largest to date genome-wide genotype-by-sex (G×S) interaction of risk for these 
      disorders using 85,735 cases (33,403 SCZ, 19,924 BIP, and 32,408 MDD) and 109,946 
      controls from the PGC (Psychiatric Genomics Consortium) and iPSYCH. RESULTS: Across 
      disorders, genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphism-by-sex interaction 
      was detected for a locus encompassing NKAIN2 (rs117780815, p = 3.2 × 10(-8)), which 
      interacts with sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (adenosine triphosphatase) 
      enzymes, implicating neuronal excitability. Three additional loci showed evidence (p 
      < 1 × 10(-6)) for cross-disorder G×S interaction (rs7302529, p = 1.6 × 10(-7); 
      rs73033497, p = 8.8 × 10(-7); rs7914279, p = 6.4 × 10(-7)), implicating various 
      functions. Gene-based analyses identified G×S interaction across disorders (p = 
      8.97 × 10(-7)) with transcriptional inhibitor SLTM. Most significant in SCZ was a 
      MOCOS gene locus (rs11665282, p = 1.5 × 10(-7)), implicating vascular endothelial 
      cells. Secondary analysis of the PGC-SCZ dataset detected an interaction 
      (rs13265509, p = 1.1 × 10(-7)) in a locus containing IDO2, a kynurenine pathway 
      enzyme with immunoregulatory functions implicated in SCZ, BIP, and MDD. Pathway 
      enrichment analysis detected significant G×S interaction of genes regulating 
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor signaling in MDD (false discovery 
      rate-corrected p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In the largest genome-wide G×S analysis of 
      mood and psychotic disorders to date, there was substantial genetic overlap between 
      the sexes. However, significant sex-dependent effects were enriched for genes 
      related to neuronal development and immune and vascular functions across and within 
      SCZ, BIP, and MDD at the variant, gene, and pathway levels.

TI  - Cohort Profile: a population-based cohort to study non-motor symptoms in 
      parkinsonism (EPIPARK).
PG  - 128-128k
LID - 10.1093/ije/dys202 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease is increasingly viewed as a complex disorder including a range 
      of typical non-motor symptoms in addition to the cardinal motor signs. This cohort 
      was set up in 2010 to investigate the specificity of non-motor symptoms for 
      Parkinson's disease. For this, we included several control groups with decreasing 
      contrast from Parkinson's disease patients. Group definitions ranged from healthy 
      control subjects to those with suspected early motor signs of parkinsonism. Using a 
      mailed questionnaire, we screened 5838 inhabitants of Lübeck, Germany, out of a 
      target population of 10 000 citizens, enquiring about motor impairment, pain, 
      quality of life, comorbidities, somatization and demographics. Based on this 
      information, participants were assigned to screening groups, and selected 
      participants were invited for in-person examination (n = 623). The examination 
      included cognitive examinations, transcranial ultrasound, a brief psychiatric 
      interview and a standardized motor examination that was used to assign examination 
      groups. In addition, all participants answered questionnaires addressing depression, 
      anxiety, sleep and quality of life. The first-year follow-up examination was 
      performed either in person using the same protocol or via mailed questionnaires.

PG  - e000564
LID - 10.1136/tsaco-2020-000564 [doi]
LID - e000564
AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the incidence and modifiable risk factors of delirium in 
      surgical intensive care unit (SICU) of tertiary care hospital in a low-income and 
      middle-income country. METHODS: We conducted a single cohort observational study in 
      patients over 18 years of age who were admitted to the SICU for >24 hours in Aga 
      Khan University Hospital from January to December 2016. Patients who had 
      pre-existing cognitive dysfunction were excluded. Intensive Care Delirium Screening 
      Checklist was used to assess delirium. Incidence of delirium was computed, and 
      univariate and multivariable analyses were performed to observe the relationship 
      between outcome and associated factors. RESULTS: The average patient age was 
      43.29±17.38 and body mass index was 26.25±3.57 kg/m(2). Delirium was observed in 19 
      of 87 patients with an incidence rate of 21.8%. Multivariable analysis showed 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pain score >4 and hypernatremia were strong 
      predictors of delirium. Midazolam (adjusted OR (aOR)=7.37; 95% CI 2.04 to 26.61) and 
      propofol exposure (aOR=7.02; 95% CI 1.92 to 25.76) were the strongest independent 
      predictors of delirium while analgesic exposures were not statistically significant 
      to predict delirium in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Delirium is a significant 
      risk factor of poor outcome in SICU. There was an independent association between 
      pain, sedation, COPD, hypernatremia and fever in developing delirium. LEVEL OF 
      EVIDENCE: IV.

AB  - We present the pre to post bilateral globus pallidus interna (GPi) deep brain 
      stimulation neuropsychological profiles of a 69-year-old patient with a 12-year 
      history of X-linked dystonia-Parkinsonism (XDP). Pre-operative cognitive function 
      was impaired in almost all domains and this impaired performance was not dependent 
      on his medications. Following DBS, changes in neuropsychological functioning were 
      examined using Reliable Change Indices and standardized z-score comparisons. Results 
      showed reductions in processing speed in the context of stable performance in 
      language and visuospatial domains. Post-operative improvements occurred on a 
      cognitive screening measure, verbal memory, and a test of problem-solving skills. 
      This is the first report on an individual with XDP who was cognitively impaired, but 
      had good outcome following GPi bilateral stimulation to treat debilitating motor 
      symptoms. The possible mechanisms for his stable cognitive performance include the 
      target of his DBS, reduced medication dosage, and improvement in dystonia that may 
      in turn have reduced patient's pain.

TI  - Process quality indicators targeting cognitive impairment to support quality of care 
      for older people with cognitive impairment in emergency departments.
PG  - 285-98
LID - 10.1111/acem.12616 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to develop process quality indicators 
      (PQIs) to support the improvement of care services for older people with cognitive 
      impairment in emergency departments (ED). METHODS: A structured research approach 
      was taken for the development of PQIs for the care of older people with cognitive 
      impairment in EDs, including combining available evidence with expert opinion (phase 
      1), a field study (phase 2), and formal voting (phase 3). A systematic review of the 
      literature identified ED processes targeting the specific care needs of older people 
      with cognitive impairment. Existing relevant PQIs were also included. By integrating 
      the scientific evidence and clinical expertise, new PQIs were drafted and, along 
      with the existing PQIs, extensively discussed by an advisory panel. These indicators 
      were field tested in eight hospitals using a cohort of older persons aged 70 years 
      and older. After analysis of the field study data (indicator prevalence, variability 
      across sites), in a second meeting, the advisory panel further defined the PQIs. The 
      advisory panel formally voted for selection of those PQIs that were most appropriate 
      for care evaluation. RESULTS: In addition to seven previously published PQIs 
      relevant to the care of older persons, 15 new indicators were created. These 22 PQIs 
      were then field tested. PQIs designed specifically for the older ED population with 
      cognitive impairment were only scored for patients with identified cognitive 
      impairment. Following formal voting, a total of 11 PQIs were included in the set. 
      These PQIs targeted cognitive screening, delirium screening, delirium risk 
      assessment, evaluation of acute change in mental status, delirium etiology, proxy 
      notification, collateral history, involvement of a nominated support person, pain 
      assessment, postdischarge follow-up, and ED length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      article presents a set of PQIs for the evaluation of the care for older people with 
      cognitive impairment in EDs. The variation in indicator triggering across different 
      ED sites suggests that there are opportunities for quality improvement in care for 
      this vulnerable group. Applied PQIs will identify an emergency services' 
      implementation of care strategies for cognitively impaired older ED patients. 
      Awareness of the PQI triggers at an ED level enables implementation of targeted 
      interventions to improve any suboptimal processes of care. Further validation and 
      utility of the indicators in a wider population is now indicated.

TI  - Association Among Preoperative Cognitive Performance, Regional Cerebral Oxygen 
      Saturation, and Postoperative Delirium in Older Portuguese Patients.
PG  - 846-855
LID - 10.1213/ANE.0000000000005159 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium is common among older patients and preoperative 
      identification of high-risk patients is widely recommended. The aim of this study 
      was to assess whether preoperative cognitive performance using brief screening tools 
      or regional cerebral oxygen saturation (Scto2) was associated with the development 
      of postoperative delirium in older Portuguese patients undergoing elective surgery. 
      METHODS: Prospective observational cohort study where preoperative cognitive 
      screening tools (Mini-Cog, Mini-Mental State Examination, verbal fluency) and Scto2 
      (INVOS 5100C; Medtronic, Ireland) were assessed in 238 patients ≥65 years old 
      undergoing elective surgery between July 2017 and May 2019 at a tertiary academic 
      center in Portugal. The primary outcome was postoperative delirium detected by the 
      3D-Confusion Assessment Method. Data were analyzed by univariate analysis and 
      multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 53 patients 
      (22%); 162 patients (68%) had completed only 4 years of education. On multivariable 
      analysis, probable cognitive impairment tested by the Mini-Cog (odds ratio [OR] = 
      1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.70-3.53; corrected P value >.999), by the 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (OR = 2.75; 95% CI, 1.23-6.13; corrected P value = 
      .052), and by the animal verbal fluency test (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 0.49-3.16; 
      corrected P value >.999) were not significantly associated with the development of 
      postoperative delirium. In contrast, lower preoperative Scto2 (OR = 1.08; 95% CI, 
      1.02-1.14; corrected P value = .024 for each point decrease in Scto2) was associated 
      with postoperative delirium. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find enough evidence to suggest 
      that poor preoperative cognitive performance was significantly associated with the 
      development of postoperative delirium in an older Portuguese surgical population 
      with an overall low level of formal education, but rather that preoperative Scto2 
      may be helpful in identifying patients at risk for delirium.

TI  - Using psychometric ability to improve education in ultrasound-guided regional 
      anaesthesia: a multicentre randomised controlled trial.
PG  - 911-917
LID - 10.1111/anae.15353 [doi]
AB  - The learning curve for novices developing regional anaesthesia skills, such as 
      real-time ultrasound-guided needle manipulation, may be affected by innate 
      visuospatial ability, as this influences spatial cognition and motor co-ordination. 
      We conducted a multinational randomised controlled trial to test if novices with low 
      visuospatial ability would perform better at an ultrasound-guided needling task with 
      deliberate practice training than with discovery learning. Visuospatial ability was 
      evaluated using the mental rotations test-A. We recruited 140 medical students and 
      randomly allocated them into low-ability control (discovery learning), low-ability 
      intervention (received deliberate practice), high-ability control, and high-ability 
      intervention groups. Primary outcome was the time taken to complete the needling 
      task, and there was no significant difference between groups: median (IQR [range]) 
      low-ability control 125 s (69-237 [43-600 s]); low-ability intervention 163 s 
      (116-276 [44-600 s]); high-ability control 130 s (80-210 [41-384 s]); and 
      high-ability intervention 177 s (113-285 [43-547 s]), p = 0.06. No difference was 
      found using the global rating scale: mean (95%CI) low-ability control 53% (95%CI 
      46-60%); low-ability intervention 61% (95%CI 53-68%); high-ability control 63% 
      (95%CI 56-70%); and high-ability intervention 66% (95%CI 60-72%), p = 0.05. For 
      overall procedure pass/fail, the low-ability control group pass rate of 42% (14/33) 
      was significantly less than the other three groups: low-ability intervention 69% 
      (25/36); high-ability control 68% (25/37); and high-ability intervention 85% (29/34) 
      p = 0.003. Further research is required to determine the role of visuospatial 
      ability screening in training for ultrasound-guided needle skills.

TI  - Regression-Based Normative Formulae for the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of 
      Neuropsychological Status for Older Adults.
PG  - 600-4
LID - 10.1093/arclin/acv052 [doi]
AB  - The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) has 
      become a popular cognitive screening instrument, particularly in elderly patients. 
      Prior studies presented lookup tables for RBANS normative data based on age, gender, 
      education, and race using a group of 718 community-dwelling older adults. However, 
      regression-based normative formulae that simultaneously correct for all demographic 
      variables may be more sensitive for detecting late life cognitive decline. Using 
      data from the prior studies, linear regression was used to generate such formulae in 
      the Indexes and subtests of the RBANS. Results indicated that ∼11% of the variance 
      of Index scores was accounted for by these demographic variables, and 13% of 
      variance in subtest scores. Although some differences were present between the 
      lookup and regression-based norms, it is expected that these current results will 
      present more accurate demographic corrections that allow clinicians and researchers 
      to better interpret individual performances on the RBANS.

LID - 10.1093/bja/aeu163 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Since general anaesthesia invariably accompanies surgery, the 
      contribution of each to the development of postoperative cognitive dysfunction 
      (POCD) has been difficult to identify. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled 
      trial was undertaken in elderly patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave 
      lithotripsy (ESWL). Between 2005 and 2011, 2706 individuals were screened to recruit 
      100 eligible patients. Patients were randomly assigned to receive general or spinal 
      anaesthesia alone. A battery of eight neuropsychological tests was administered 
      before operation and at 7 days and 3 months after operation. The reliable change 
      index was used to calculate the incidence of POCD. Intention-to-treat analysis was 
      used to compare rates of POCD. RESULTS: Futility analysis led to stopping of the 
      trial after recruitment of 100 patients. Fifty patients were randomly assigned to 
      general anaesthesia, and 48 patients to spinal anaesthesia without sedation or 
      postoperative opioids. At 3 months, POCD was detected in 6.8% [95% confidence 
      interval (CI): 1.4-18.7%] of patients in the general anaesthesia group and 19.6% 
      (95% CI: 9.4-33.9%) in the spinal group (P=0.07). At 7 days after operation, the 
      incidence of POCD was 4.1% (95% CI: 0.5-14%) in the general anaesthesia group and 
      11.9% (95% CI: 4.0-26.6%) in the spinal group (P=0.16). CONCLUSIONS: We found no 
      significant difference in the rates of POCD when comparing general anaesthesia with 
      spinal anaesthesia, suggesting that the surgical or procedural process itself may 
      contribute to the development of POCD. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian

TI  - Altering intensive care sedation paradigms to improve patient outcomes.
PG  - 663-74
LID - 10.1016/j.anclin.2011.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Providing sedation and comfort for intensive care patients has evolved in the last 
      30 years but remains difficult for clinicians. As research has focused on this 
      challenging area, the authors have identified ways to improve practice, including 
      providing analgesia before sedation, strategies to help recognize dangerous adverse 
      effects associated with the medications that are used, and better ways to monitor 
      pain and delirium in patients. Dexmedetomidine and propofol have become the 
      preferred sedatives for many ICU situations, and creative ways to administer them, 
      such as linking awakening and breathing trials, are emerging. Finally, screening

TI  - Steroids to reduce the impact on delirium (STRIDE): a double-blind, randomised, 
      placebo-controlled feasibility trial of pre-operative dexamethasone in people with 
      hip fracture.
LID - 10.1111/anae.15465 [doi]
AB  - Neuro-inflammation may be important in the pathogenesis of postoperative delirium 
      following hip fracture surgery. Studies have suggested a potential role for steroids 
      in reducing postoperative delirium; however, the potential efficacy and safety of 
      pre-operative high-dose dexamethasone in this specific population is largely 
      unknown. Conducting such a study could be challenging, considering the 
      multidisciplinary team involvement and the emergency nature of the surgery. The aim 
      of this study was to assess feasibility and effectiveness of dexamethasone given as 
      early as possible following hospital admission for hip fracture, to inform whether a 
      full-scale trial is warranted. This single-centre, randomised, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled study randomly allocated 79 participants undergoing hip fracture 
      surgery to dexamethasone 20 mg or placebo pre-operatively. Eligibility and 
      recruitment rates, timing of the intervention and adverse events were recorded. 
      Incidence and severity of postoperative delirium were assessed using the 4AT 
      delirium screening tool and the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale. Postoperative 
      pain, length of stay and mortality were also assessed. The eligibility rate for 
      inclusion was 178/527 (34%), and 57/178 (32%) of eligible patients presented to 
      hospital when no researcher was available (e.g. after-hours, weekends, public 
      holidays). Recruitment was limited mainly by ethical limitations (not including 
      patients with impaired cognition) and lack of weekend staffing. Median (IQR [range]) 
      time from emergency department admission to drug administration was 13.3 (5.9-17.6 
      [1.8-139.6]) hours. There was a significant difference in delirium severity scores, 
      favouring the dexamethasone group: median (IQR [range]) 5 (3-6 [3-7]) vs. 9 (6-13 
      [5-14]) in the placebo group, with the probability of superiority effect size being 
      0.89, p = 0.010. Delirium incidence did not differ between groups: 6/40 (15%) in the 
      dexamethasone group vs. 9/39 (23%) in the placebo group, relative risk (95%CI) 0.65 
      (0.22-1.65), p = 0.360). A larger randomised controlled trial is feasible and 
      ideally this should include people with existing cognitive impairment, seven 
      days-a-week cover and a multicentre design.

TI  - Investigation of Childhood Lead Poisoning from Parental Take-Home Exposure from an 
      Electronic Scrap Recycling Facility — Ohio, 2012.
PG  - 743-5
AB  - Lead affects the developing nervous system of children, and no safe blood lead level 
      (BLL) in children has been identified. Elevated BLLs in childhood are associated 
      with hyperactivity, attention problems, conduct problems, and impairment in 
      cognition. Young children are at higher risk for environmental lead exposure from 
      putting their hands or contaminated objects in their mouth. Although deteriorating 
      lead paint in pre-1979 housing is the most common source of lead exposure in 
      children, data indicate that ≥30% of children with elevated BLLs were exposed 
      through a source other than paint. Take-home contamination occurs when lead dust is 
      transferred from the workplace on employees' skin, clothing, shoes, and other 
      personal items to their car and home. Recycling of used electronics (e-scrap) is a 
      relatively recent source of exposure to developmental neurotoxicants, including 
      lead. In 2010, the Cincinnati Health Department and Cincinnati Children's Hospital 
      Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Unit (PEHSU) investigated two cases of 
      childhood lead poisoning in a single family. In 2012, CDC's National Institute for 
      Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) learned about the lead poisonings during an 
      evaluation of the e-scrap recycling facility where the father of the two children 
      with lead poisoning worked. This report summarizes the case investigation. 
      Pediatricians should ask about parents' occupations and hobbies that might involve 
      lead when evaluating elevated BLLs in children, in routine lead screening 
      questionnaires, and in evaluating children with signs or symptoms of lead exposure.

TI  - Preoperative Cognitive Impairment and the Prevalence of Postoperative Delirium in 
      Elderly Cancer Patients-A Prospective Observational Study.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11020275 [doi]
LID - 275
AB  - Preoperative cognitive impairment (PCI) in cancer patients includes a broad spectrum 
      of neurocognitive changes produced by complex interplay of patient, tumoural and 
      treatment-related factors. Reduced preoperative cognitive reserve can favour the 
      emergence of postoperative delirium (POD). The study aims to document PCI prevalence 
      and to assess the relationship with POD in elderly cancer patients. The prospective 
      observational study included consecutive patients scheduled for elective surgery; 
      PCI was assessed with Mini-Cog test and defined at a score ≤ 3, POD was screened 
      using Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (Nu-DESC) and defined at a score ≥ 2. Data on 
      education, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score, preoperative 
      medications, substance use, comorbidities, sensorial deficits, surgery and 
      anaesthesia type, anaesthetic drugs, Mini-Cog score, postoperative pain, Nu-DESC 
      were collected. In total, 131 patients were enrolled, mean age 72.1 ± 5.9 years. PCI 
      prevalence was 51.9% (n = 68). POD prevalence was 19.8% (n = 26), with significantly 
      higher value in PCI patients (27.9% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.016). In multivariate analysis, 
      Mini-Cog score ≤ 3 (OR = 2.6, p = 0.027), clock draw (OR: 2.9, p = 0.013), 
      preoperative renal dysfunction (OR = 2.6, p = 0.012), morphine (OR = 2.7, p = 
      0.007), metoclopramide (OR = 6.6, p = 0.006), and high pain score (OR = 1.8, p = 
      0.018) had a significant association with POD development. In this sample of elderly 
      patients, PCI had a high prevalence and predicted the emergence of POD. 
      Incorporating Mini-Cog test into the preoperative evaluation of onco-geriatric 
      patients seems valuable and feasible.

AB  - STUDY DESIGN: This is a case report. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to 
      report on a brain-computer interface (BCI) paradigm that is successfully used with 
      an inpatient spinal cord injury patient. SETTING: This study was conducted in an 
      inpatient rehabilitation hospital. METHODS: A 25-year-old man with a C5 burst 
      fracture and subsequent tetraplegia (The American Spinal Injury Association) 
      participated in this case study. He completed a brief battery of psychological, 
      pain, cognitive and other screening measures at points before and after the BCI 
      paradigm during his rehabilitation hospitalization. RESULTS: The paradigm was easily 
      learned and well tolerated with no adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: This case is 
      reflective of the trends in our ongoing feasibility study evaluating BCI technology 
      in the inpatient rehabilitation setting. Clinical implications and challenges of 
      using this technology in a busy hospital unit are reviewed.

TI  - Psychometric testing of the brief screening version of Multidimensional Pain 
      Inventory (Swedish version).
PG  - 171-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-6712.2008.00602.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The brief screening version of the Multidimensional Pain inventory (MPI) 
      is a shorter version of the West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory that 
      measures pain in a multidimensional way and is theoretically linked to a 
      cognitive-behavioural perspective on chronic pain. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study 
      was to psychometrically evaluate the 'brief screening version' of the 
      Multidimensional Pain inventory Swedish version (MPI-S). METHODS: An age-stratified 
      cross-sectional study, comprising 384 people aged 18-102 years, was carried out in 
      southern Sweden in 2005. Factor analyses were performed to investigate the factor 
      structure of the instrument and inter-correlation between the sub-scales as well as 
      external measures were used to assess convergent and discriminant validity. 
      Reliability was assessed by internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha). RESULTS: Mean 
      scores and standard deviations are presented for the total sample as well as for 
      each stratum. The inter-correlations revealed that discriminant validity was not 
      satisfactory in the total sample, although the correlation analysis in each stratum 
      showed acceptable discriminant validity in most age groups. The factor structure was 
      the same as in the MPI-S in all age groups, except for those aged >or=90 years. 
      Reliability tests (Cronbach's alpha) showed alpha values ranging between 0.68 and 
      0.93. CONCLUSION: The result showed that the instrument had acceptable validity and 
      reliability in all age groups except for those aged >or=90 years. Thus, the 
      instrument can be seen as a useful (multidimensional) form of screening for chronic 
      pain.

TI  - Patient-identified most bothersome symptom in preventive migraine treatment with 
      eptinezumab: A novel patient-centered outcome.
PG  - 766-776
LID - 10.1111/head.14120 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe the methodology and implications of the patient-identified 
      most bothersome symptom (PI-MBS) measure used in the phase 3, multicenter, 
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and parallel-group PROMISE-2 trial and 
      to evaluate the contribution of this measure to the assessment of the preventive 
      migraine benefits of treatment. BACKGROUND: Although freedom from MBS is a coprimary 
      endpoint in acute migraine treatment trials, its evaluation in preventive migraine 
      trials is limited. The PROMISE-2 study assessed a unique PI-MBS measure as a 
      secondary endpoint. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of data from the 
      PROMISE-2 study. Adults with chronic migraine (CM) were randomized to receive 
      intravenous (IV) eptinezumab 100 mg, eptinezumab 300 mg, or placebo, administered on 
      day 0 and every 12 weeks. At the screening visit, patients were asked to verbally 
      describe the MBS associated with their CM; the question format was open ended. At 
      subsequent visits, patients were asked to rate the overall change in severity of 
      their MBS from study inception to that time point, using a 7-point ordinal scale 
      ranging from "very much worse" (-3) to "very much improved" (+3). Patients completed 
      the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) assessment during the same visits, 
      using an identical rating scale and recall period. Endpoints were summarized 
      descriptively; post hoc correlations using the methodologies of Pearson and Spearman 
      were calculated to evaluate relationships between PGIC and PI-MBS and between PGIC 
      and mean monthly migraine days (MMDs; primary efficacy endpoint in PROMISE-2). 
      RESULTS: Altogether, 1072 patients received treatment (eptinezumab 100 mg, n = 356; 
      eptinezumab 300 mg, n = 350; placebo, n = 366) and were included in the analysis. 
      There were 23 unique MBS identified; those reported by ≥10 patients included light 
      sensitivity (18.7%), nausea/vomiting (15.1%), pain with activity (13.7%), pain 
      (12.4%), headache (11.2%), sound sensitivity (7.3%), throbbing/pulsating pain 
      (4.7%), cognitive disruption (4.1%), fatigue (2.4%), mood changes (1.5%), and 
      sensitivity to smell (0.9%). Four weeks after the first dose (week 4), the rates of 
      much or very much improvement in PI-MBS were higher with eptinezumab 100 mg (45%) 
      and 300 mg (57%) than with placebo (29%). Four weeks after the second dose (week 
      16), the proportions with much or very much improvement in PI-MBS had increased to 
      58%, 65%, and 36%, respectively. At each time point, the percentages of patients 
      with PGIC ratings of much or very much improved were similar to those for 
      patient-reported improvement in PI-MBS. Patient ratings of changes in PI-MBS and 
      PGIC correlated strongly across time points (Pearson, r range, 0.83-0.88; Spearman, 
      r range, 0.83-0.89); the absolute value of the correlations was greater than the 
      correlation among changes in MMDs and PGIC (Pearson, r range, -0.49 to -0.52; 
      Spearman, r range, -0.49 to -0.52). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with CM in the 
      PROMISE-2 study, a broad range of PI-MBS was reported at baseline. Throughout the 
      study, patients treated with eptinezumab reported greater improvement in their 
      PI-MBS severity compared with placebo recipients, and this improvement correlated 
      strongly with PGIC findings. Collectively, these results indicate that PI-MBS is a 
      promising and novel outcome measure for preventive trials of CM and thus may provide 
      a unique patient-centered approach for identifying and measuring the burden of 
      migraine symptoms that matter most to each patient, as well as the benefits of 
      treatment.

TI  - Fluorescent- and tagged-protoxin II peptides: potent markers of the Na(v) 1.7 
      channel pain target.
PG  - 2632-2650
LID - 10.1111/bph.15453 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Protoxin II (ProTx II) is a high affinity gating modifier 
      that is thought to selectively block the Na(v) 1.7 voltage-dependent Na(+) channel, 
      a major therapeutic target for the control of pain. We aimed at producing ProTx II 
      analogues entitled with novel functionalities for cell distribution studies and 
      biochemical characterization of its Na(v) channel targets. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We 
      took advantage of the high affinity properties of the peptide, combined to its slow 
      off rate, to design a number of new tagged analogues useful for imaging and 
      biochemistry purposes. We used high-throughput automated patch-clamp to identify the 
      analogues best matching the native properties of ProTx II and validated them on 
      various Na(v) -expressing cells in pull-down and cell distribution studies. KEY 
      RESULTS: Two of the produced ProTx II analogues, Biot-ProTx II and ATTO488-ProTx II, 
      best emulate the pharmacological properties of unlabelled ProTx II, whereas other 
      analogues remain high affinity blockers of Na(v) 1.7. The biotinylated version of 
      ProTx II efficiently works for the pull-down of several Na(v) isoforms tested in a 
      concentration-dependent manner, whereas the fluorescent ATTO488-ProTx II 
      specifically labels the Na(v) 1.7 channel over other Na(v) isoforms tested in 
      various experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The properties of 
      these ProTx II analogues as tools for Na(v) channel purification and cell 
      distribution studies pave the way for a better understanding of ProTx II channel 
      receptors in pain and their pathophysiological implications in sensory neuronal 
      processing. The new fluorescent ProTx II should also be useful in the design of new 
      drug screening strategies.

AB  - To discuss the changes in cognitive function and related brain regions in patients 
      with chronic benzene poisoning. Few studies have explored the damage to cognitive 
      function that occurs in benzene toxic encephalopathy. It is important to identify 
      early in the course of disease whether cognitive dysfunction is caused by benzene 
      poisoning so that disease prognosis and appropriate treatment can be determined. We 
      reported on the chronic benzene poisoning of a 41-year-old Han Chinese woman. The 
      patient had graduated from primary school, and she had a cheerful and diligent 
      personality. She had performed painting work for more than five years, and her 
      primary work involved painting swivel chairs. The primary reasons she attended the 
      psychiatric clinic were loss of appetite, she had experienced fatigue for more than 
      2 months, and she had had memory loss for a month. These symptoms seriously impacted 
      the patient's daily life and ability to work. The patient's husband expressed 
      concern that she could not recognize acquaintances, could not find her way home, and 
      had lost approximately 5 kg per month over two months. We analyzed changes in this 
      chronic benzene poisoning patient's cognitive function with cognitive function 
      assessments and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Measurements were taken on 
      presentation to hospital, during the patient's hospitalization, and three months 
      following discharge. Long-term exposure to benzene can damage the central nervous 
      system. However, it is difficult to recognize when cognitive impairment is caused by 
      chronic benzene poisoning, as it rarely presents with a decline in cognitive 
      function as the primary clinical manifestation. Atypical symptoms, such as decreased 
      immune function and gastrointestinal issues, may be the first symptoms to appear, 
      and these atypical symptoms are difficult to detect in the early stages of disease. 
      Regular screening of high-risk groups is required to significantly reduce the 
      incidence of systemic damage caused by benzene poisoning.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive frailty (CF) is associated with dementia and disability. It 
      was initially proposed in 2013 by the International Institute of Nutrition and Aging 
      and the International Geriatrics Association. Over the years, there have been many 
      emerging definitions e.g., Motoric Cognitive Risk Syndrome (MCR), Physio-cognitive 
      Decline Syndrome (PCDS), reversible CF and potentially reversible CF. OBJECTIVE: Our 
      objective was to determine the demographics including physical, functional, and 
      psychosocial factors for the four CF definitions amongst community-dwelling older 
      adults. In addition, the effect of dual-task exercise on the reversibility of 
      different definitions of CF was also studied. METHODS: Participants were 
      community-dwelling older adults aged ≥60 years recruited between August 2017 and 
      December 2019. Older adults screened to be frail, prefrail or have cognitive 
      impairment were invited to participate in dual-task exercise program called HAPPY 
      (Healthy Ageing Promotion Program for You). Improvement in cognition, frailty, and 
      physical performance after a 3-month dual-task exercise intervention program was 
      compared with controls. RESULTS: The prevalence of CF depending on definition ranged 
      from 8.8% to 28.7% with minimal overlap. The cognitive scores were significantly 
      lower in all the groups predominantly affecting non-memory domains except for 
      reversible CF. Frailty was three to seven times more prevalent in CF. MCR group had 
      higher prevalence of functional limitation, pain and depression. All four groups had 
      significant increase in global cognition scores especially in the attention domain 
      where the control group declined, and reduction in the prevalence of frailty post 
      intervention. MCR and reversible CF were significantly associated with increased 
      odds of cognitive improvement after 3 months of intervention compared with control. 
      CONCLUSION: CF is a novel concept and regardless of the definitions, is a target for 
      reversing frailty, functional limitation and cognitive impairment through dual-task 
      exercise. Long-term prospective studies are needed to evaluate the effectiveness of 
      dual-task interventions in delaying the conversion to dementia and reduction of 
      disability.

TI  - The Evolutionary History of Common Genetic Variants Influencing Human Cortical 
      Surface Area.
PG  - 1873-1887
LID - 10.1093/cercor/bhaa327 [doi]
AB  - Structural brain changes along the lineage leading to modern Homo sapiens 
      contributed to our distinctive cognitive and social abilities. However, the 
      evolutionarily relevant molecular variants impacting key aspects of neuroanatomy are 
      largely unknown. Here, we integrate evolutionary annotations of the genome at 
      diverse timescales with common variant associations from large-scale neuroimaging 
      genetic screens. We find that alleles with evidence of recent positive polygenic 
      selection over the past 2000-3000 years are associated with increased surface area 
      (SA) of the entire cortex, as well as specific regions, including those involved in 
      spoken language and visual processing. Therefore, polygenic selective pressures 
      impact the structure of specific cortical areas even over relatively recent 
      timescales. Moreover, common sequence variation within human gained enhancers active 
      in the prenatal cortex is associated with postnatal global SA. We show that such 
      variation modulates the function of a regulatory element of the developmentally 
      relevant transcription factor HEY2 in human neural progenitor cells and is 
      associated with structural changes in the inferior frontal cortex. These results 
      indicate that non-coding genomic regions active during prenatal cortical development 
      are involved in the evolution of human brain structure and identify novel regulatory 
      elements and genes impacting modern human brain structure.

TI  - Multimorbidity and Subjective Cognitive Complaints: Findings from 48 Low- and 
      Middle-Income Countries of the World Health Survey 2002-2004.
LID - 10.3233/JAD-201592 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on the association between multimorbidity and subjective cognitive 
      complaints (SCC) are lacking from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). 
      OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between multimorbidity and SCC among adults 
      from 48 LMICs. METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based data were analyzed from the 
      World Health Survey 2002-2004. Ten chronic conditions (angina, arthritis, asthma, 
      chronic back pain, depression, diabetes, edentulism, hearing problems, tuberculosis, 
      visual impairment) were assessed. Two questions on subjective memory and learning 
      complaints in the past 30 days were used to create a SCC scale ranging from 0 (No 
      SCC) to 100 (worse SCC). Multivariable linear regression and mediation analyses were 
      conducted to explore the associations. RESULTS: A total of 224,842 individuals 
      aged≥18 years [mean (SD) age 38.3 (16.0) years; 49.3% males] constituted the final 
      sample. Compared to no chronic conditions, the mean SCC score was higher by 7.13 
      (95% CI = 6.57-7.69), 14.84 (95% CI = 13.91-15.77), 21.10 (95% CI = 19.49-22.70), 
      27.48 (95% CI = 25.20-29.76), and 33.99 (95% CI = 31.45-36.53) points for 1, 2, 3, 
      4, and≥5 chronic conditions. Estimates by sex and age groups (18-44, 45-64,≥65 
      years) were similar. Nearly 30% of the association between multimorbidity (i.e.,≥2 
      chronic conditions) and SCC was explained by psychological factors (i.e., perceived 
      stress, sleep problems, anxiety symptoms). CONCLUSION: Multimorbidity is associated 
      with SCC among adults in LMICs. Future studies should investigate whether addressing 
      psychological factors in people with multimorbidity can improve cognitive function, 
      and whether screening for SCC in individuals with multimorbidity can be a useful 
      tool to identify individuals at particularly high risk for future cognitive decline.

TI  - Dysmorphic features, cognitive disability, chronic inflammation, and predisposition 
      to vascular disease in two sisters: a new autosomal recessive disorder?
PG  - 8-10
LID - 10.1097/MCD.0b013e32834c59a8 [doi]
AB  - A 20-year-old woman presented with mental retardation and a history of stroke 
      related to moyamoya disease at the age of 8 years. She had cognitive impairment 
      which became more pronounced after the stroke. This patient's parents were first 
      cousins and six close family relatives had strokes in their 60s or 70s. The 
      patient's 16-year-old sister had learning disability, chronic muscle pain, and an 
      ECG suggestive of previous hypoxemic heart injury. The two sisters had similar 
      dysmorphic facial appearance including a prominent philtrum, bulbous nose, and 
      severe acne. They both had increased subcutaneous tissue in their faces, whereas 
      their bodies were slim. Both sisters were found to have elevated levels of 
      rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate on repeat 
      measurements. Partial autoimmunity screening in one of the patients was negative. 
      Chromosome analysis and array comparative genomic hybridization analyses were also 
      normal. Nerve conduction findings in the younger sister were consistent with distal, 
      predominantly motor, demyelinating neuropathy localized to the lower extremities. We 
      propose that these two sisters suffer from a new autosomal recessive syndrome. 
      Carrier status for this condition may predispose to later onset stroke.

TI  - A 2-min cognitive screener for predicting 1-year functional recovery and survival in 
      older adults after hip fracture repair.
LID - glab156 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/gerona/glab156 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Implementing cognitive assessment in older people admitted to hospital 
      with hip fracture - lying in bed, experiencing pain - is challenging. We 
      investigated the value of a quick and easy-to-administer 10-point cognitive screener 
      (10-CS) in predicting 1-year functional recovery and survival after hip surgery. 
      METHODS: Prospective cohort study comprising 304 older patients (mean age=80.3±9.1 
      years; women=72%) with hip fracture consecutively admitted to a specialized academic 
      medical center that supports secondary hospitals in Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, 
      Brazil. The 10-CS, a 2-minute bedside tool including temporal orientation, verbal 
      fluency, and three-word recall, classified patients as having normal cognition, 
      possible cognitive impairment, or probable cognitive impairment on admission. 
      Outcomes were time-to-recovery activities of daily living (ADLs; Katz index) and 
      mobility (New Mobility Score), and survival during 1-year after hip surgery. Hazard 
      models, considering death as a competing risk, were used to associate the 10-CS 
      categories with outcomes after adjusting for sociodemographic and clinical measures. 
      RESULTS: On admission, 144 (47%) patients had probable cognitive impairment. 
      Compared to those cognitively normal, patients with probable cognitive impairment 
      presented less postsurgical recovery of ADLs (77% vs. 40%; adjusted sub-hazard ratio 
      [HR]=0.44; 95%CI=0.32-0.62) and mobility (50% vs. 30%; adjusted sub-HR=0.52; 
      95%CI=0.34-0.79), and higher risk of death (15% vs. 40%; adjusted HR=2.08; 
      95%CI=1.03-4.20) over 1-year follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The 10-CS is a strong predictor 
      of functional recovery and survival after hip fracture repair. Cognitive assessment 
      using quick and easy-to-administer screening tools like 10-CS can help clinicians 
      make better decisions and offer tailored care for older patients admitted with hip 
      fracture.

TI  - The Impact of Plasma Cholinergic Enzyme Activity and Other Risk Factors for the 
      Development of Delirium in Patients Receiving Palliative Care.

LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2016.05.015 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Delirium is an important complication in palliative care patients. One of 
      the potential risk factors for cognitive disorders is deterioration in cholinergic 
      neurotransmission. Anticholinergic medications are known to be important owing to 
      the association of their metabolites with significant morbidity, which is often the 
      result of cumulative effects of medications (anticholinergic burden). Additionally, 
      cholinergic enzymes are possible candidates reflecting the cholinergic situation in 
      patients. However, the role of cholinesterases (CHE) for delirium in palliative care 
      patients is unknown. OBJECTIVES: Following local Ethics Board approval and written 
      informed consent, we recruited a cohort of patients who had been admitted to the 
      Heidelberg University Palliative Care Unit related to CHE and other factors at risk 
      for delirium. METHODS: Delirium was assessed using the Nursing Delirium Screening 
      Scale once daily in all cancer patients (N = 100) during their stay on the 
      palliative care unit. In a subgroup of 69 probes, blood samples were analyzed for 
      acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase activity spectrophotometrically. Furthermore, 
      patients' medications were recorded. Logistic regression analysis was used to 
      evaluate potential predictors of delirium. RESULTS: Delirium was identified in 29% 
      of patients. Karnofsky Performance Status Scale score was significantly lower 
      (P = 0.021) and mortality higher (P = 0.018) in patients with delirium. Plasma CHE 
      activity was not associated with delirium. However, a significant effect of 
      anticholinergic medication on plasma CHE activity was detected; so far midazolam 
      (P = 0.01) seems to play an important role in that process. CONCLUSION: Special care 
      might be necessary with anticholinergic medication to minimize risk for delirium in 
      palliative cancer patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Painful physical symptoms (PPS) are common in patients with major 
      depressive disorder (MDD), but their prevalence has been mixed. This is a systematic 
      review and meta-analysis of the pooled prevalence of PPS in MDD patients. METHODS: 
      Systematic literature searches were independently conducted in major databases 
      (PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science). Data analyses were conducted using a 
      random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 20 studies with 53,852 patients were 
      included. The overall prevalence of PPS in MDD patients was 55.2% (95%CI: 
      47.9-62.3%), with a point prevalence of 64.2% (95% CI: 53.2-73.8%) and a 12-month 
      prevalence of 57.0% (95%CI: 23.9-84.8%). No significant publication bias was found 
      in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: PPS are common in MDD patients. Considering the 
      negative impact of PPS on daily functioning, effective preventive measures and 
      routine screening should be conducted for MMD patients, and timely treatments should 
      be offered to those in need. Registration number: CRD42020179471.

LID - 1352
AB  - A novel approach to ageing studies assessed the discriminatory ability of a 
      combination of routine physical function tests and novel measures, notably muscle 
      mechanical properties and thigh composition (ultrasound imaging) to classify healthy 
      individuals according to age and gender. The cross-sectional study included 138 
      community-dwelling, self-reported healthy males and females (65 young, mean age ± SD 
      = 25.7 ± 4.8 years; 73 older, 74.9 ± 5.9 years). Handgrip strength; quadriceps 
      strength; respiratory peak flow; timed up and go; stair climbing time; anterior 
      thigh tissue thickness; muscle stiffness, tone, elasticity (Myoton technology), and 
      self-reported health related quality of life (SF36) were assessed. Stepwise feature 
      selection using cross-validation with linear discriminant analysis was used to 
      classify cases based on criterion variable derived from known effects of age on 
      physical function. A model was trained and features selected using 126 cases with 
      0.92 accuracy (95% CI = 0.86-0.96; Kappa = 0.89). The final model included five 
      features (peak flow, timed up and go, biceps brachii elasticity, anterior thigh 
      muscle thickness, and percentage thigh muscle) with high sensitivity (0.82-0.96) and 
      specificity (0.94-0.99). The most sensitive novel biomarkers require no volition, 
      highlighting potentially useful tests for screening and monitoring effects of 
      interventions on musculoskeletal health for vulnerable older people with pain or 
      cognitive impairment.

TI  - Behavioral pharmacogenetic analysis on the role of the α4 GABA(A) receptor subunit 
      in the ethanol-mediated impairment of hippocampus-dependent contextual learning.
PG  - 1948-59
LID - 10.1111/j.1530-0277.2011.01546.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major effect of low-dose ethanol is impairment of 
      hippocampus-dependent cognitive function. α4/δ -containing GABA(A) Rs are highly 
      expressed within the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus where they mediate a 
      tonic inhibitory current that is sensitive to the enhancement by low ethanol 
      concentrations. These receptors are also powerful modulators of learning and memory, 
      suggesting that they could play an important role in ethanol's cognitive impairing 
      effects. The goal of this study was to develop a high-throughput cognitive ethanol 
      assay, amenable to use in genetically modified mice that could be used to test this 
      hypothesis. METHODS: We developed a procedure where preexposure to a conditioning 
      chamber is used to rescue the "immediate shock deficit." Using this task, ethanol 
      can be specifically targeted at the hippocampus-dependent process of contextual 
      learning without interfering with pain sensitivity or behavioral performance. 
      RESULTS: Validation of this task in C57BL/6 mice indicated that 1.0 g/kg ethanol and 
      10 mg/kg allopregnanolone disrupt contextual learning. Ro15-4513 reversed the 
      effects of ethanol but not allopregnanolone, whereas it produced an impairment when 
      given alone. The high-throughput nature of this task allowed for its application in 
      a large cohort of α4 GABA(A) R KO mice. Loss of the α4 GABA(A) R subunit produced an 
      enhanced sensitivity to the cognitive impairing effects of ethanol. This is 
      consistent with the enhanced ethanol sensitivity of synaptic GABA(A) Rs that has 
      been previously observed in the dentate gyrus in these mice, but inconsistent with 
      the reduced ethanol sensitivity of extrasynaptic GABA(A) Rs observed in the same 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings are consistent with our hypothesis that 
      ethanol acts directly at GABA(A) receptors to impair hippocampus-dependent cognitive 
      function. Furthermore, validation of this high-throughput assay will allow for 
      future studies to use anatomically and temporally restricted genetic manipulations 
      to probe more deeply into the neural mechanisms of ethanol action on learning and 
      memory circuits.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Delirium is one of the most common complications in older surgical 
      patients. Although previous studies reported that preoperative malnutrition was 
      related with postoperative delirium (POD), there was lack of evidence to illustrate 
      the relationship between malnutrition and emergency delirium (ED). The objective of 
      this study was to investigate the relationship between preoperative malnutrition and 
      ED in older patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. METHODS: The study was carried 
      out in accordance with STROBE guidelines. This was a secondary analysis of a 
      prospective cohort study. Older patients (65-90 years) who underwent noncardiac 
      surgery under general anesthesia were enrolled in Peking University First Hospital. 
      RESULTS: 915 patients were enrolled. The incidence of malnutrition was 53.6 % 
      (490/915). The incidence of emergency delirium was 41.8 % (205/490) in malnutrition 
      group and 31.5 % (134/425) in control group, P < 0.001. After adjusting confounding 
      factors (i.e., age, cognitive impairment, American Society of Anesthesiologists 
      classification (ASA), duration of surgery, pain score, low body temperature and 
      allogeneic blood transfusion), malnutrition was not associated with increased risk 
      of emergency delirium (OR = 1.055, 95 % CI 0.767-1.452, P = 0.742). CONCLUSIONS: 
      Malnutrition was common in older patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, but it's 
      not related with emergence delirium after adjusted for confounders. TRIAL

AB  - AIM: To develop a screening tool that was short, not time consuming but able to 
      detect the patients' main problems at admission. METHODS: A list of 106 
      symptoms/problems derived from a review of the literature was created and shortened 
      using a Delphi process. RESULTS: Thirteen experts scored each item with a numeric 
      rating scale of 0 to 10 for relevance. After 3 rounds, the list was shortened to 14 
      items: general question--what bothers you the most? symptoms/problems--pain, lack of 
      appetite, vomiting, tiredness/fatigue, nausea, constipation, shortness of breath, 
      depression, anxiety, difficulty sleeping; activity (dressing, washing, etc); support 
      from family/friends; and well-being. CONCLUSION: The final tool is short and seems 
      to include the relevant items that would make it useful for clinical practice.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to identify novel serum biomarkers 
      specific to postoperative delirium after major cardiac surgery to provide insight 
      into the pathologic processes involved in delirium and its sequelae. DESIGN: Nested, 
      case-control study. SETTING: Cardiac surgical intensive care unit in a single-site 
      hospital setting. PARTICIPANTS: The study comprised 24 older adults (aged >60 years) 
      undergoing major cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. INTERVENTIONS: None. 
      MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The primary outcome was a positive screen for 
      delirium from postoperative days one through three based on criteria included in the 
      long form of the Confusion Assessment Method. A multiplexed proteomic approach was 
      applied using proximity extension assays to identify and quantify proteins found in 
      serum collected on the day of surgery and postoperative day one in delirious and 
      nondelirious patient cohorts. An increase in serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 
      levels was identified in the delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of (mean ± 
      standard deviation) 5.0 ± 1.1 log2 abundance (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.3-5.7) 
      to 6.7 ± 1.6 log2 abundance (95% CI, 5.7-7.7; p = 0.01) postsurgery. A similar 
      increase was identified in FGF-23 from a presurgery baseline of 1.7 ± 1.3 log2 
      abundance (95% CI, 0.8-2.5) to 3.4 ± 2.2 log2 abundance (95% CI, 2.0-4.8; p = 0.06) 
      postsurgery. An increase in interleukin-6 serum levels also was identified in the 
      delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of 3.8 ± 1.1 log2 abundance (95% CI, 
      3.1-4.5) to 8.7 ± 1.9 log2 abundance (95% CI, 7.5-9.9; p < 0.0001) postsurgery. 
      However, the increase in interleukin-6 serum levels of the nondelirious cohort also 
      met the study's threshold for statistical significance (p < 0.0001). Finally, an 
      increase in monocyte chemotactic protein-3 serum levels was identified in the 
      delirious cohort from a presurgery baseline of 4.1 ± 0.9 log2 abundance (95% CI, 
      3.6-4.7) to 6.1 ± 2.0 log2 abundance (95% CI, 4.8-7; p = 0.009) postsurgery. 
      CONCLUSIONS: FGF-21, FGF-23, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemotactic protein-3 serum 
      levels were increased postoperatively in patients who developed delirium after major 
      cardiac surgery. This study identified two members of the FGF family as potential 
      putative systemic biomarkers for postoperative delirium after cardiac surgery, 
      suggesting a possible role for metabolic recovery in the pathophysiologic mechanisms 
      underlying neurocognitive dysfunction.

AB  - Impairment of spatial memory, including an inability to recall previous locations 
      and navigate the world, is often one of the first signs of functional disability on 
      the road to cognitive impairment. While there are many screening and diagnostic 
      tools which attempt to measure spatial memory ability, they are often not 
      representative of real-life situations and can therefore lack applicability. One 
      potential solution to this problem involves the use of virtual reality (VR), which 
      immerses individuals in a virtually-simulated environment, allowing for scenarios 
      more representative of real-life without any of the associated risks. Here, we 
      review the evidence surrounding the use of VR for the screening and diagnosis of 
      spatial memory impairments, including potential limitations and how it compares to 
      standard neuropsychological tests. We will also discuss the evidence regarding the 
      potential use of VR in the rehabilitation of spatial memory deficits, which has not 
      been well studied, but which could be game-changing if proven successful.

TI  - Detection of symptoms of late complications after stroke in young survivors with 
      active surveillance versus usual care.
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/09638288.2021.1883749 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Stroke survivors develop late complications after stroke (LCAS) that impair 
      return to pre-stroke responsibilities. Optimal strategies for detection have not 
      been developed. We assessed differences in LCAS symptom detection among young stroke 
      survivors undergoing active surveillance versus usual care. METHODS: This was a 
      retrospective cohort study including patients age 18-50 with ischemic stroke, 
      transient ischemic attack, or intracerebral hemorrhage evaluated in a Stroke Clinic 
      between 1/1/2016-12/31/2017 with at least one outpatient evaluation during the first 
      year after stroke. "Active surveillance" involved a semi-structured interview to 
      elicit LCAS symptoms including headache, seizures, lethargy, mood disorders, 
      cognitive impairment, central pain, insomnia, spasticity, dystonia, and orthostasis. 
      "Usual care" did not involve the interview. Rates of LCAS symptom detection were 
      assessed at 0-3 months and 3-12 months. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one stroke 
      survivors were included, of which 37% (45) underwent active surveillance. There were 
      no differences in baseline characteristics except hospitalization location. Patients 
      undergoing active surveillance were more likely to have at least one LCAS symptom 
      detected (77% vs 49% at 0-3 months, p = 0.02; 81% vs. 54% at 3-12 months, 
      p = 0.008). Active surveillance was more likely to detect symptoms of non-motor 
      LCAS. There were no differences for motor LCAS. CONCLUSIONS: Active surveillance 
      leads to higher rates of early symptom detection of non-motor LCAS in young stroke 
      survivors.Implications for rehabilitationYoung stroke survivors frequently have late 
      complications after stroke (LCAS) that impair return to pre-stroke 
      responsibilities.Active surveillance for LCAS symptoms with a semi-structured 
      interview increases detection of non-motor late complications.A bundled approach to 
      screening for LCAS symptoms is pragmatic as a majority of young stroke survivors 
      have at least one symptom but no single symptom is present in all stroke survivors.

AB  - Preexisting cognitive impairment is an important, but underrecognized, predictor of 
      postoperative neurocognitive dysfunction, a common and important sequela of surgery. 
      We have applied computerized neuropsychological testing as an efficient and reliable 
      means of detecting preexisting cognitive impairment in two studies of cardiac and 
      noncardiac surgical populations and propose that this tool has great potential in 
      routine clinical diagnosis.

AB  - Data from several studies indicate an association of headache with anxiety 
      disorders. In this study, we assessed and differentiated anxiety disorders in 100 
      headache patients by using the PSWQ (Penn State Worry Questionnaire) screening tool 
      for generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) and the ACQ (Agoraphobic Cognitions 
      Questionnaire) and BSQ (Body Sensation Questionnaire) for panic disorder (PD). 
      Control groups were constructed: (1) on the basis of epidemiological studies on PD 
      and GAD in the general population and (2) by including neurological patients. 37.0% 
      of headache patients had a GAD. 27% of headache patients met the score for PD in the 
      BSQ, 4.0% in the ACQ. Significant results were obtained in comparison to the general 
      population (p < 0.001) and with regard to GAD in comparison with a sample of 
      neurological patients (p < 0.005). The BSQ significantly correlated with the number 
      of medication days (p < 0.005). The results confirm the increased prevalence of GAD 
      in headache patients. PD seems to increase the risk of medication overuse.

TI  - Predicting the transition from acute to persistent low back pain.
PG  - 127-31
LID - 10.1093/occmed/kqq194 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Most people experience low back pain (LBP) at least once in their 
      lifetime. Only a minority of them go on to develop persistent LBP. However, the 
      socioeconomic costs of persistent LBP significantly exceed the costs of the initial 
      acute LBP episode. AIMS: To identify factors that influence the progression of acute 
      LBP to the persistent state at an early stage. METHODS: Prospective inception cohort 
      study of patients attending a health practitioner for their first episode of acute 
      LBP or recurrent LBP after a pain free period of at least 6 months. Patients were 
      assessed at baseline addressing occupational and psychological factors as well as 
      pain, disability, quality of life and physical activity and followed up at 3, 6, 12 
      weeks and 6 months. Variables were combined to the three indices 'working 
      condition', 'depression and maladaptive cognitions' and 'pain and quality of life'. 
      RESULTS: The index 'depression and maladaptive cognitions' was found to be a 
      significant baseline predictor for persistent LBP up to 6 months (OR 5.1; 95% CI: 
      1.04-25.1). Overall predictive accuracy of the model was 81%. CONCLUSIONS: In this 
      study of patients with acute LBP in a primary care setting psychological factors at 
      baseline correlated with a progression to persistent LBP up to 6 months. The benefit 
      of including factors such as 'depression and maladaptive cognition' in screening 
      tools is that these factors can be addressed in primary and secondary prevention.

      Scale into Korean. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between June 2008 and December 2008, a 
      linguistic adaptation was carried out by 2 native Korean speakers who were also 
      fluent in English. First, the original English version of the PUF was translated 
      into Korean. A panel, which included the 2 translators, reviewed the translations to 
      form a single reconciled forward translation of the Korean version. Then, another 
      bilingual translator, having never seen the original version, back-translated the 
      first draft of the Korean version of the PUF into English, and this back-translation 
      was subsequently assessed for equivalence to the original. The panel discussed all 
      discrepancies and produced a second version. After revising the 2nd version, 10 
      participants [5 interstitial cystitis (IC) patients and 5 persons from the general 
      population], stratified variously by age, sex, and educational level, answered the 
      PUF and were systematically debriefed afterwards. A summary of the changes from the 
      patient interviews were incorporated into the third version. After the spelling, 
      grammar, layout, and formatting were checked, the third version was verified as the 
      final Korean version of the PUF, without modifications. RESULTS: The multi-step 
      process of forward translation, reconciliation, back-translation, cognitive 
      debriefing, and proofreading of the Korean version of the PUF was completed. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The Korean version of the PUF scale may be helpful for screening IC 
      patients in the Korean population and can now be used in Korea.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Define associations between post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) fatigue and 
      abnormalities in neuroendocrine axes, sleep, mood, cognition and physical 
      functioning. DESIGN: Survey. SETTING: Large community hospital-based rehabilitation 
      centre. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample of 119 individuals at least 1 year 
      post-TBI. OUTCOME MEASURES: Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue (MAF); Fatigue 
      Severity Scale (FSS); neuroendocrine assessments-growth hormone (GH) reserve, 
      thyroid, cortisol and testosterone levels; visual analogue pain rating; Pittsburgh 
      Sleep Quality Index; Beck Depression Inventory-II; Disability Rating Scale; Craig 
      Handicap Assessment and Reporting Technique; Neurobehavioural Functioning Inventory. 
      RESULTS: Fifty-three per cent reported fatigue on the MAF and one-third on the FSS; 
      65% were found to have moderate/severe GH deficiency; 64% had adrenal insufficiency 
      (low fasting cortisol); 12% had central hypothyroidism; and 15% of men had 
      testosterone deficiency. Pituitary dysfunction did not correlate with fatigue or 
      other symptoms. Predictors of MAF total scores were female gender, depression, pain 
      and self-assessed memory deficits. Predictors of FSS scores were depression, 
      self-assessed motor deficits and anti-depressant usage. CONCLUSIONS: Robust 
      correlates of fatigue were gender, depression, pain and memory and motor 
      dysfunction. Investigation of post-TBI fatigue should include screening for 
      depression, pain and sleep disturbance. There was no correlation between pituitary 
      dysfunction and fatigue; however, the relatively high prevalence of hypothyroidism 
      and adrenal dysfunction suggests screening for these hormone deficiencies.

      adults with cancer.
PG  - 7-16
LID - 10.1188/10.ONF.S1.7-16 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To describe approaches to pain assessment in cognitively intact 
      and cognitively impaired older adults with cancer. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE literature 
      search, personal reference collection, and clinical experience. DATA SYNTHESIS: A 
      systematic and comprehensive pain assessment is the cornerstone of effective 
      treatment strategies. Determining the effect of pain on older adults' ability to 
      function is as important as rating pain intensity. Evidence-based recommendations 
      exist to guide practice. CONCLUSIONS: The undertreatment of pain in older adults 
      persists despite a plethora of published guidelines addressing pain assessment and 
      management. Unrelieved pain affects recovery from illness and all aspects of life. 
      Systematic and ongoing assessment is elementary to effective pain management, yet 
      assessments frequently are neither completed nor documented. Because pain is 
      subjective and individual responses to pain interventions vary widely and are 
      unpredictable, assessment is vital to comprehensive pain care in all clinical 
      settings. Reliable and validated pain assessment tools for cognitively intact and 
      cognitively impaired older adults are available to guide practice. IMPLICATIONS FOR 
      NURSING: Pain assessment is a core competency for nurses in all clinical settings. 
      Comprehensive, individualized, and ongoing assessment provides the information 
      necessary so that clinicians can develop interventions to relieve patients' pain and 
      improve their quality of life. Nurses have the knowledge, skills, and tools to 
      adequately screen and comprehensively assess pain in older adult patients, including 
      those with cognitive impairment. By using this knowledge, nurses can change systems 
      and practices, have a significant effect on improving pain care, and increase 
      quality of life and function of older adults with pain.

TI  - Validation of Doloplus-2 among nonverbal nursing home patients--an evaluation of 
      Doloplus-2 in a clinical setting.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/1471-2318-10-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain measurement in nonverbal older adults is best based on behavioural 
      observation, e.g. using an observational measurement tool such as Doloplus-2. The 
      purposes of this study were to examine the use of Doloplus-2 in a nonverbal nursing 
      home population, and to evaluate its reliability and validity by comparing 
      registered nurses' estimation of pain with Doloplus-2 scores. METHOD: In this 
      cross-sectional study, Doloplus-2 was used to observe the pain behaviour of patients 
      aged above 65 years who were unable to self-report their pain. Nurses also recorded 
      their perceptions of patient pain (yes, no, don't know) before they used Doloplus-2. 
      Data on demographics, medical diagnoses, and prescribed pain treatment were 
      collected from patient records. Daily life functioning was measured and participants 
      were screened using the Mini Mental State Examination. RESULTS: In total, 77 nursing 
      home patients were included, 75% were women and the mean age was 86 years (SD 6.6, 
      range 68-100). Over 50% were dependent on nursing care to a high or a medium degree, 
      and all were severely cognitively impaired. The percentage of zero scores on 
      Doloplus-2 ranged from 17% (somatic reactions) to 40% (psychosocial reactions). 
      Cronbach's alpha was 0.71 for the total scale. In total, 52% of the patients were 
      judged by nurses to be experiencing pain, compared with 68% when using Doloplus-2 (p 
      = 0.01). For 29% of the sample, nurses were unable to report if the patients were in 
      pain. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, more patients were categorized as having 
      pain while using Doloplus-2 compared with nurses' estimation of pain without using 
      any tools. The fact that nurses could not report if the patients were in pain in one 
      third of the patients supports the claim that Doloplus-2 is a useful supplement for 
      estimating pain in this population. However, nurses must use their clinical 
      experience in addition to the use of Doloplus-2, as behaviour can have different 
      meaning for different patients. Further research is still needed about the use of 
      Doloplus-2 in patients not able to self-report their pain.

TI  - Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia.
PG  - S14-21
LID - 10.1016/j.amjmed.2009.09.007 [doi]
AB  - Fibromyalgia is a chronic functional illness that presents with widespread 
      musculoskeletal pain as well as a constellation of symptoms including fatigue, 
      cognitive dysfunction, sleep difficulties, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood. 
      The diagnosis of fibromyalgia, similar to other functional disorders, requires that 
      organic diseases are not causing the symptoms. Systemic and rheumatic diseases can 
      be ruled out by a patient history, physical examination, and laboratory 
      investigations. Because there are no specific laboratory tests for fibromyalgia, the 
      1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria have been used 
      in clinical settings; however, they are not ideal for individual patient diagnosis. 
      Clinicians should be aware of limitations inherent in using tender points in the 
      diagnosis of fibromyalgia. The multiple symptoms of fibromyalgia often overlap with 
      those of related disorders and may further complicate the diagnosis. One of the most 
      challenging diagnostic dilemmas that clinicians face is distinguishing fibromyalgia 
      from other central pain disorders (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue 
      syndrome, migraine). Screening questions based on published criteria can be used as 
      a first approach in diagnosing functional illnesses. Numerous studies report a 
      higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders in patients with fibromyalgia. Therefore, 
      a careful history and evaluation should be taken for the presence of primary mood 
      disturbances. To date, there is no "gold standard" for diagnosing fibromyalgia. 
      Until a better clinical case definition of fibromyalgia exists, all diagnostic 
      criteria should be interpreted with caution, considered rudimentary, and subject to 
      modification.

TI  - Catastrophizing as a cognitive vulnerability factor related to depression in 
      workers' compensation patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain.
PG  - 182-92
LID - 10.1007/s10880-008-9118-7 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the role of catastrophizing as a mediator 
      and moderator between life stress and depression in a sample of workers' 
      compensation patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. Pain intensity, life stress 
      (especially work and financial stress), and catastrophizing contributed 
      significantly to depression. Catastrophizing was found to be partially mediating the 
      relationship between life stress and depression and a moderator between social 
      stress and depression. The results supported the role of catastrophizing as a 
      cognitive vulnerability-stress factor related to depression in chronic pain 
      patients. Screening for life stress and intervening early to prevent catastrophizing 
      from occurring in the workers' compensation rehabilitation process may reduce 
      psychosocial distress and enhance the overall effectiveness of rehabilitation 
      programming for workers' compensation patients with chronic pain.

TI  - Screening for pain in patients with cognitive and communication difficulties: 
      evaluation of the SPIN-screen.
PG  - 393-8
AB  - ABSTRACT - The scale of pain intensity (SPIN)-screen is a simple visual tool for the 
      screening and measurement of pain intensity, which is designed to be accessible by 
      patients with cognitive and communication problems. It was applied prospectively in 
      a consecutive cohort of 79 patients admitted to a tertiary specialist 
      neurorehabilitation unit, of which 86% had significant cognitive/communicative 
      disabilities. In all, 71 patients (90%) responded to the SPIN. Concurrent validation 
      against a standard numbered graphic rating scale (NGRS) showed a strong overall 
      correlation (rho 0.94 p < 0.0001). When the NGRS was converted to an equivalent 
      six-point scale, weighted Kappa tests demonstrated 'almost perfect' agreement (K = 
      0.81, SE 0.083) between the two sets of ratings. Repeat testing after 24 hours 
      provided preliminary evidence for the stability and responsiveness of the 
      SPIN-screen, but these require further evaluation. Of those who expressed a 
      preference for one tool over the other, 70% preferred the SPIN. The study provides 
      support for application of the SPIN-screen as a routine screening tool in this group 
      of patients.

TI  - Effects of attention on the control of locomotion in individuals with chronic low 
      back pain.
PG  - 13
LID - 10.1186/1743-0003-5-13 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: People who suffer from low back pain (LBP) exhibit an abnormal gait 
      pattern, characterized by shorter stride length, greater step width, and an impaired 
      thorax-pelvis coordination which may undermine functional walking. As a result, gait 
      in LBP may require stronger cognitive regulation compared to pain free subjects 
      thereby affecting the degree of automaticity of gait control. Conversely, because 
      chronic pain has a strong attentional component, diverting attention away from the 
      pain might facilitate a more efficient walking pattern. METHODS: Twelve individuals 
      with LBP and fourteen controls participated. Subjects walked on a treadmill at 
      comfortable speed, under varying conditions of attentional load: (a) no secondary 
      task, (b) naming the colors of squares on a screen, (c) naming the colors of color 
      words ("color Stroop task"), and (d) naming the colors of words depicting motor 
      activities. Markers were attached to the thorax, pelvis and feet. Motion was 
      recorded using a three-camera SIMI system with a sample frequency of 100 Hz. To 
      examine the effects of health status and attention on gait, mean and variability of 
      stride parameters were calculated. The coordination between thoracic and pelvic 
      rotations was quantified through the mean and variability of the relative phase 
      between those oscillations. RESULTS: LBP sufferers had a lower walking speed, and 
      consequently a smaller stride length and lower mean thorax-pelvis relative phase. 
      Stride length variability was significantly lower in the LBP group but no 
      significant effect of attention was observed. In both groups gait adaptations were 
      found under performance of an attention demanding task, but significantly more so in 
      individuals with LBP as indicated by an interaction effect on relative phase 
      variability. CONCLUSION: Gait in LBP sufferers was characterized by less variable 
      upper body movements. The diminished flexibility in trunk coordination was 
      aggravated under the influence of an attention demanding task. This provides further 
      evidence that individuals with LBP tighten their gait control, and this suggests a 
      stronger cognitive regulation of gait coordination in LBP. These changes in gait 
      coordination reduce the capability to deal with unexpected perturbations, and are 
      therefore maladaptive.

      screening tools.
PG  - 338-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to evaluate the cognitive complexity and 
      reading demands of patient self-administered Opioid Assessment Screening Tools 
      (OASTs) for use in adults with nonmalignant pain. METHODS: Using comprehensive 
      search strategies, we identified english-language OASTs with established validity 
      and reliability for inclusion in our study. Cognitive complexity of individual OAST 
      statements or questions were assessed using three techniques (number of items, 
      number of words, and linguistic problems), whereas readability was measured using 
      the Flesch-Kinkaid formula. RESULTS: Four (n=4) were identified and included in our 
      review: Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM), Pain Medication Questionnaire (PMQ), 
      Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patient with Pain, and Screening Tool for 
      Addiction Risk (STAR). Number of total OAST statements or questions ranged from a 
      low of 14 (STAR) to a high of 26 (PMQ), whereas number of words (length) per 
      statement or question averaged from a low of 10.2 +/- 1.1 (STAR) to a high of 15.9 
      +/- 3.8 (PMQ). The STAR (1.3 +/- 1.1) had the fewest number of linguistic problems 
      per statement or question, whereas the PMQ (3.0 +/- 1.4) had the most linguistic 
      problems per statement or question. Although, readability of OASTs ranged from 
      approximately sixth (STAR) to eighth (COMM, PMQ) grade, there was notable variation 
      in readability across individual statements or questions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      demonstrates that formatting characteristics, including linguistic problems, and 
      high readability of several OAST statements or questions may hinder many patients' 
      ability to accurately complete and comprehend OASTs independently.

TI  - [Depressive and anxiety symptoms, coping strategies in patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease].
PG  - 212-21
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Psychological factors play an important role in the etiopathogenesis 
      of functional gastrointestinal disorders, like irritable bowel syndrome. In our 
      study we compared certain psychological characteristics of patients suffering from 
      functional and organic gastrointestinal disorders and healthy subjects. METHODS: Age 
      and gender matched irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease patients 
      and healthy subjects were compared on their depressive symptoms (Beck Depression 
      Inventory), anxiety symptoms (Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory) and coping 
      strategies (Folkman-Lazarus Ways of Coping Questionnaire). RESULTS: GI patients 
      groups were characterized by significantly more severe depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms and by the prevalence of passive coping strategies. On the Beck Depression 
      Inventory "Performance Difficulty" and "Somatic Symptoms" subscales, significant 
      differences were observed between patients and healthy subjects, while on the 
      "Negative affect" subscale, only IBS patients but not IBD patients scored 
      significantly higher compared to healthy subjects. The functional GI group showed 
      significantly more severe depressive and also more severe anxiety symptoms, but this 
      latter did not reach statistical significance. No differences were detected 
      regarding the use of coping strategies. DISCUSSION: Psychological screening and 
      psychological and/or pharmacological interventions are recommended for GI patients, 
      at least in the most severe and treatment resistant cases. Differences between IBS 
      and IBD groups underline the importance of the increased psychic vulnerability of 
      functional GI patients and emphasize the role of affective components in the 
      etiopathogenesis of the disorder. Future studies should be directed toward the 
      assessment of disease-specific psychic characteristics (e.g. pain-coping strategies, 
      cognitive schemas), subjective symptom experience and illness-behavior.

TI  - A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of repeated IV antibiotic therapy for Lyme 
      encephalopathy.
PG  - 992-1003
AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment remains uncertain for patients with cognitive 
      impairment that persists or returns after standard IV antibiotic therapy for Lyme 
      disease. METHODS: Patients had well-documented Lyme disease, with at least 3 weeks 
      of prior IV antibiotics, current positive IgG Western blot, and objective memory 
      impairment. Healthy individuals served as controls for practice effects. Patients 
      were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of double-masked treatment with IV ceftriaxone or 
      IV placebo and then no antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome was neurocognitive 
      performance at week 12-specifically, memory. Durability of benefit was evaluated at 
      week 24. Group differences were estimated according to longitudinal mixed-effects 
      models. RESULTS: After screening 3368 patients and 305 volunteers, 37 patients and 
      20 healthy individuals enrolled. Enrolled patients had mild to moderate cognitive 
      impairment and marked levels of fatigue, pain, and impaired physical functioning. 
      Across six cognitive domains, a significant treatment-by-time interaction favored 
      the antibiotic-treated group at week 12. The improvement was generalized (not 
      specific to domain) and moderate in magnitude, but it was not sustained to week 24. 
      On secondary outcome, patients with more severe fatigue, pain, and impaired physical 
      functioning who received antibiotics were improved at week 12, and this was 
      sustained to week 24 for pain and physical functioning. Adverse events from either 
      the study medication or the PICC line were noted among 6 of 23 (26.1%) patients 
      given IV ceftriaxone and among 1 of 14 (7.1%) patients given IV placebo; these 
      resolved without permanent injury. CONCLUSION: IV ceftriaxone therapy results in 
      short-term cognitive improvement for patients with posttreatment Lyme 
      encephalopathy, but relapse in cognition occurs after the antibiotic is 
      discontinued. Treatment strategies that result in sustained cognitive improvement 
      are needed.

TI  - Neuronal nicotinic receptors: a perspective on two decades of drug discovery 
      research.
PG  - 1092-101
AB  - Neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) have been a target for drug 
      discovery efforts, primarily for CNS indications, for the past two decades. While 
      nicotine and related natural products have been used for smoking cessation in 
      various formulations (e.g., gum, spray, patches), it was only in 2006 with the 
      launch of varenicline (Chantix) by Pfizer for smoking cessation that a new chemical 
      entity (NCE) originating from a rational medicinal chemistry effort targeting 
      neuronal AChRs was approved. The current overview outlines the chronology of drug 
      discovery efforts in nAChRs from the cloning of the receptor family in the 1980s, to 
      initial research efforts at SIBIA, R.J. Reynolds and Abbott, to the current 
      industry-wide interest in nAChR agonists as novel therapeutics for pain, 
      schizophrenia and Alzheimer's Disease. Key events in the evolution of the nAChR 
      field were the development of high throughput electrophysiological screening tools 
      that provided the means to enable lead optimization efforts in medicinal chemistry 
      and the discovery by John Daly at the NIH of the frog alkaloid, epibatidine, that 
      provided the framework for the discovery of ABT-594, an alpha4beta2 agonist that is 
      200 times more potent than morphine as an analgesic. Over the next decade, it is 
      anticipated that additional NCEs including antagonists and allosteric modulators 
      (both positive and negative), interacting with various nAChR subtypes, will be 
      advanced to the clinic in areas of high unmet medical need, e.g., pain, 
      neurodegeneration, to provide novel medications with improved efficacy.

TI  - Factors associated with delirium severity among older patients.
PG  - 819-31
AB  - AIM: The goal of this study was to determine whether the factors associated with 
      delirium varied according to the severity of the delirium experienced by the older 
      patients. BACKGROUND: Delirium among older patients is prevalent and leads to 
      numerous detrimental effects. The negative consequences of delirium are worse among 
      older adults with severe delirium compared with patients with mild delirium. There 
      has been no study identifying those factors associated with delirium severity among 
      long-term care older patients newly admitted to an acute care hospital. DESIGN: This 
      is a descriptive study. METHODS: This is a secondary analysis study of 
      institutionalized older patients newly admitted to an acute care hospital (n = 104). 
      Upon admission, patients were screened for delirium with the Confusion Assessment 
      Method and severity of delirium symptoms were determined by using the Delirium 
      Index. RESULTS: Of the 71 delirious older patients, 32 (45.1%) had moderate-severe 
      delirium while 39 (54.9%) presented mild delirium. In univariate analyses, a 
      significant positive relationship was observed between the level of prior cognitive 
      impairment and the severity of delirium (p = 0.0058). Low mini-mental state 
      examination (MMSE) scores (p < 0.0001), the presence of severe illness at the time 
      of hospitalization (p = 0.0016) and low functional autonomy (BI: p = 0.0017; 
      instrumental activities of daily living: p = 0.0003) were significantly associated 
      with moderate-severe delirium. Older patients suffering from mild delirium used 
      significantly more drugs (p = 0.0056), notably narcotics (p = 0.0017), than those 
      with moderate-severe delirium. Results from the stepwise regression indicated that 
      MMSE score at admission and narcotic medication use are the factors most strongly 
      associated with the severity of delirium symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This present study 
      indicates that factors associated with moderate-severe delirium are different from 
      those associated with mild delirium. Given the result concerning the role of 
      narcotics, future studies should evaluate the role of pain management in the context 
      of delirium severity. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: As moderate-severe delirium is 
      associated with poorer outcomes than is mild delirium, early risk factor 
      identification for moderate-severe delirium by nurses may prove to be of value in 
      preventing further deterioration of those older patients afflicted with delirium.

TI  - Differences in high and low anxiety sensitive women's responses to a 
      laboratory-based cold pressor task.
PG  - 189-97
AB  - Anxiety sensitivity (AS) has been linked to a variety of disabling chronic health 
      conditions, including pain-related conditions. A recent study has found that healthy 
      women with high AS reported significantly higher levels of sensory and affective 
      pain on an experimental cold pressor task compared to women with low AS. However, 
      this study found no differences between AS groups for pain tolerance or pain 
      threshold. In the present study, which was designed to replicate and extend these 
      findings, 90 undergraduate university women were selected for inclusion in 1 of 2 AS 
      groups (high or low) based on their screening scores on a 16-item measure of AS. 
      Participants were tested individually on a lab-based cold pressor task using a 
      variety of self-report and observer-measured variables. Data analyses revealed that, 
      as expected, the high AS participants reported significantly more fear in response 
      to the cold pressor on a relevant item of the McGill Pain Questionnaire-Short Form 
      (SF-MPQ) than did the low AS participants. Also as expected, the high AS 
      participants reported more pain in response to the cold pressor on the Present Pain 
      Index (PPI) of the SF-MPQ than did the low AS participants. High AS participants did 
      not differ from low AS participants on other aspects of the cold pressor response 
      (e.g. pain threshold, pain tolerance, pain recovery). These results support the role 
      of pain-related fear as a mediating variable between AS and increased perceived pain 
      intensity.

TI  - Treatment challenges and complications with ziconotide monotherapy in established 
      pump patients.
PG  - 147-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved Ziconotide 
      intrathecal infusion for the management of severe chronic pain in patients for whom 
      intrathecal therapy is warranted, and who are intolerant of, or refractory to, other 
      methods of treatment, including intrathecal morphine. Ziconotide is approved as a 
      monotherapy, but there are challenges associated with the decision to wean 
      intrathecal opioids for Ziconotide alone. Maintaining adequate analgesia and 
      managing opioid withdrawal symptoms may be difficult. Additionally, a variety of 
      adverse physiological, cognitive and psychiatric events may be associated with this 
      new drug. Patients with pretreatment psychiatric disorders may be at increased risk 
      for treatment complications. OBJECTIVE: To present a report of a case series 
      describing treatment challenges and complications associated with the decision to 
      convert established pump patients from intrathecal opioid therapy to Ziconotide 
      monotherapy. DESCRIPTION OF CASES: Three established pump patients, refractory to 
      intrathecal opioid therapy, were converted to Ziconotide monotherapy. All of these 
      patients experienced significant emotional distress or psychological symptoms that 
      threatened the success of the treatment. Achieving adequate analgesia, reducing 
      Ziconotide to mitigate adverse physiological effects, managing opioid withdrawal 
      symptoms, and supportive psychological consultation were combined to achieve 
      successful outcomes in two of our three patients. CONCLUSION: This report describes 
      challenges associated with the decision to convert established pump patients from 
      intrathecal opioid therapy to Ziconotide monotherapy. Inadequate analgesia, adverse 
      medication effects, and opioid withdrawal symptoms can precipitate a stressful 
      situation that may be perceived as dangerous or threatening by patients who are 
      predisposed to anxiety. Screening patients for psychiatric disorders, 
      anxiety-proneness and/or vulnerability to stress should be considered to reduce the 
      risk of treatment complications. A multimodal approach is strongly advocated, 
      including rapid responses of treating physicians and nurses along with strong 
      psychological support.

TI  - Pain in elderly people with severe dementia: a systematic review of behavioural pain 
      assessment tools.
PG  - 3
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain is a common and major problem among nursing home residents. The 
      prevalence of pain in elderly nursing home people is 40-80%, showing that they are 
      at great risk of experiencing pain. Since assessment of pain is an important step 
      towards the treatment of pain, there is a need for manageable, valid and reliable 
      tools to assess pain in elderly people with dementia. METHODS: This systematic 
      review identifies pain assessment scales for elderly people with severe dementia and 
      evaluates the psychometric properties and clinical utility of these instruments. 
      Relevant publications in English, German, French or Dutch, from 1988 to 2005, were 
      identified by means of an extensive search strategy in Medline, Psychinfo and 
      CINAHL, supplemented by screening citations and references. Quality judgement 
      criteria were formulated and used to evaluate the psychometric aspects of the 
      scales. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications reporting on behavioural pain assessment 
      instruments were selected for this review. Twelve observational pain assessment 
      scales (DOLOPLUS2; ECPA; ECS; Observational Pain Behavior Tool; CNPI; PACSLAC; 
      PAINAD; PADE; RaPID; Abbey Pain Scale; NOPPAIN; Pain assessment scale for use with 
      cognitively impaired adults) were identified. Findings indicate that most 
      observational scales are under development and show moderate psychometric qualities. 
      CONCLUSION: Based on the psychometric qualities and criteria regarding sensitivity 
      and clinical utility, we conclude that PACSLAC and DOLOPLUS2 are the most 
      appropriate scales currently available. Further research should focus on improving 
      these scales by further testing their validity, reliability and clinical utility.

TI  - Predictors of nonadherence to screening colonoscopy.
PG  - 989-95
AB  - BACKGROUND: Colonoscopy has become a preferred colorectal cancer (CRC) screening 
      modality. Little is known about why patients who are referred for colonoscopy do not 
      complete the recommended procedures. Prior adherence studies have evaluated 
      colonoscopy only in combination with flexible sigmoidoscopy, failed to differentiate 
      between screening and diagnostic procedures, and have examined 
      cancellations/no-shows, but not nonscheduling, as mechanisms of nonadherence. 
      METHODS: Sociodemographic predictors of screening completion were assessed in a 
      retrospective cohort of 647 patients referred for colonoscopy at a major university 
      hospital. Then, using a qualitative study design, a convenience sample of patients 
      who never completed screening after referral (n=52) was interviewed by telephone, 
      and comparisons in reported reasons for nonadherence were made by gender. RESULTS: 
      Half of all patients referred for colonoscopy failed to complete the procedure, 
      overwhelmingly because of nonscheduling. In multivariable analysis, female sex, 
      younger age, and insurance type predicted poorer adherence. Patient-reported 
      barriers to screening completion included cognitive-emotional factors (e.g., lack of 
      perceived risk for CRC, fear of pain, and concerns about modesty and the bowel 
      preparation), logistic obstacles (e.g., cost, other health problems, and competing 
      demands), and health system barriers (e.g., scheduling challenges, long waiting 
      times). Women reported more concerns about modesty and other aspects of the 
      procedure than men. Only 40% of patients were aware of alternative screening 
      options. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to screening colonoscopy referrals is sub-optimal 
      and may be improved by better communication with patients, counseling to help 
      resolve logistic barriers, and improvements in colonoscopy referral and scheduling 
      mechanisms.

TI  - Screening housing to prevent lead toxicity in children.
PG  - 305-10
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Screening children to identify those with blood lead levels > or = 10 
      microg/dl fails to protect children from lead-associated cognitive deficits and 
      behavioral problems. To broaden our efforts at primary prevention, screening 
      criteria are needed to identify lead-contaminated housing before children are unduly 
      exposed. The purpose of this study was to identify and validate housing 
      characteristics associated with children having elevated blood lead levels (> or = 
      10 microg/dl). METHODS: Two existing studies were used to examine housing 
      characteristics linked with undue lead exposure: a cross-sectional study of 205 
      children aged 12 to 31 months, and a random sample from a longitudinal study of 276 
      children followed from 6 to 24 months of age. Logistic regression analysis was 
      conducted to examine the association of children's blood lead levels > or = 10 
      microg/dl. RESULTS: The mean age of the 481 children was 17.8 months; 99 (20.6%) had 
      a blood lead concentration of 10 microg/dl or higher. The following characteristics 
      were associated with blood lead concentration > or = 10 microg/dl: floor lead 
      loading > 15 microg/ft2 (odds ratio [OR]=2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3, 
      3.8); rental housing (OR=3.2; 95% CI 1.3, 7.6); poor housing condition (OR=2.1; CI 
      1.2, 3.6); African American race (OR=3.3; CI 1.9, 6.1); paint chip ingestion 
      (OR=5.8; CI 1.3, 26.5); and soil ingestion (OR=2.2; CI 1.1, 4.2). Housing 
      characteristics including rental status, lead-contaminated floor dust, and housing 
      condition had a range of sensitivity from 47% to 92%; specificity from 28% to 76%; a 
      positive predictive value from 25% to 34%; and a negative predictive value of 85% to 
      93%. CONCLUSIONS: Housing characteristics and floor dust lead levels can be used to 
      screen housing to identify lead hazards prior to occupancy, before purchasing a 
      home, or after renovation to prevent children's exposure to lead hazards.

TI  - Which mini-mental state exam items can be used to screen for delirium and cognitive 
      impairment?
PG  - 41-50
AB  - Cognitive impairment is common in palliative care patients, but it is frequently 
      undetected. The clinical consequence is that psychiatric states such as delirium, 
      which often present with cognitive impairment, are inadequately treated. A short and 
      simple questionnaire for screening of cognitive impairment is required for these 
      patients, in order to proceed with more advanced testing if necessary. In this 
      study, we explored the results from two samples of patients (n=290 and n=217) who 
      had completed the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Cases of cognitive 
      impairment are considered indicated by an MMSE score of less than 24 of the total 
      30. We found that caseness could be fairly accurately screened by using four of the 
      original 20 MMSE items, and that a six-item questionnaire further greatly improved 
      the discrimination.

TI  - Music improves sleep quality in older adults.
PG  - 234-44
AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper is to report an investigation of the effects of soft 
      music on sleep quality in older community-dwelling men and women in Taiwan. 
      BACKGROUND: Sleep is a complex rhythmic state that may be affected by the ageing 
      process. Few studies have focused on the effects of music, a non-pharmacological 
      method of improving the quality of sleep in older adults. METHOD: A randomized 
      controlled trial was used with a two-group repeated measures design. Sixty people 
      aged 60-83 years with difficulty in sleeping were recruited through community 
      leaders and screened using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and Epworth 
      Sleepiness Scale. Those reporting depression, cognitive impairment, medical or 
      environmental problems that might interfere with sleep; and those who used sleeping 
      medications, meditation, or caffeine at bedtime were excluded. Participants listened 
      to their choice among six 45-minute sedative music tapes at bedtime for 3 weeks. 
      There were five types of Western and one of Chinese music. Sleep quality was 
      measured with the PSQI before the study and at three weekly post-tests. Groups were 
      comparable on demographic variables, anxiety, depressive symptoms, physical 
      activity, bedtime routine, herbal tea use, napping, pain, and pretest overall sleep 
      quality. RESULTS: Music resulted in significantly better sleep quality in the 
      experimental group, as well as significantly better components of sleep quality: 
      better perceived sleep quality, longer sleep duration, greater sleep efficiency, 
      shorter sleep latency, less sleep disturbance and less daytime dysfunction (P = 
      0.04-0.001). Sleep improved weekly, indicating a cumulative dose effect. CONCLUSION: 
      The findings provide evidence for the use of soothing music as an empirically-based 
      intervention for sleep in older people.

TI  - Is colour vision impairment associated with cognitive impairment in solvent exposed 
      workers?
PG  - 76-8
AB  - AIMS: To determine whether acquired colour vision deficits in solvent exposed 
      individuals are associated with cognitive impairment. METHODS: A sample of 82 
      painters and 38 other subjects were studied. Alcohol, drug, and smoking histories 
      were obtained. Colour vision was tested using the Lanthony D-15-d colour vision 
      test. Cognitive impairment was measured using the Benton visual retention test, 
      Trail making A, and Trail making B tests. Pre-morbid IQ was estimated using the 
      National Adult Reading Test. Solvent exposure in all subjects was estimated using a 
      previously validated, structured subjective assessment methodology. RESULTS: After 
      exclusion of subjects with competing causes of colour vision impairment the final 
      group of men numbered 78. There was a significant association on multiple linear 
      regression between the mean colour confusion index (CCI) and three measures of 
      cognitive impairment, the Benton visual retention test, Trail making A, and Trail 
      making B tests after adjusting for the effects of age (or IQ as appropriate), 
      alcohol, and smoking. CONCLUSION: Acquired colour vision loss is associated with 
      cognitive impairment in solvent exposed workers. However, given the prevalence of 
      acquired colour vision losses in the adult population, colour vision testing is 
      unlikely to be of value as a screening test.

TI  - Genomics and variation of ionotropic glutamate receptors.
PG  - 22-35
AB  - Sequencing of the human, mouse, and rat genomes has enabled a comprehensive 
      informatics approach to gene families. This approach is informative for 
      identification of new members of gene families, for cross-species sequence 
      conservation related to functional conservation, for within-species diversity 
      related to functional variation, and for historical effects of selection. This 
      genome informatics approach also focuses our attention on genes whose genomic 
      locations coincide with linkages to phenotypes. We are identifying ionotropic 
      glutamate receptor (IGR) sequence variation by resequencing technologies, including 
      denaturing high-performance liquid chromoatography (dHPLC), for screening and direct 
      sequencing, and by information mining of public (e.g., dbSNP and ENSEMBL) and 
      private (i.e., Celera Discovery System) sequence databases. Each of the 16 known 
      IGRs is represented in these databases, their positions on a canonical physical map 
      (for example, the Celera map) are established, and comparison to mouse and rat 
      sequences has been performed, revealing substantial conservation of these genes, 
      which are located on different chromosomes but found within syntenic groups of 
      genes. A collection of 38 missense variants were identified by the informatics and 
      resequencing approaches in several of these receptor genes, including GRIN2B, 
      GRIN3B, GRIA2, GRIA3, and GRIK1. This represents only a fraction of the sequence 
      variation across these genes, but, in fact, these may constitute a large fraction of 
      the common polymorphisms at these genes, and these polymorphisms are a starting 
      point for understanding the role of these receptors in neurogenetic variation. 
      Genetically influenced human neurobehavioral phenotypes that are likely to be linked 
      to IGR genetic variants include addictions, anxiety/dysphoria disorders, post-brain 
      injury behavioral disorders, schizophrenia, epilepsy, pain perception, learning, and 
      cognition. Thus, the effects of glutamate receptor variation may be protean, and the 
      task of relating variation to behavior difficult. However, functional variants of 
      (1) catechol-O-methyltransferase, (2) serotonin transporter, and (3) brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor have recently been linked both to behavioral differences and to 
      intermediate phenotypes, suggesting a pathway by which functional variation at IGRs 
      can be tied to an etiologically complex phenotype.

TI  - Attitudes of health care trainees about genetics and disability: issues of access, 
      health care communication, and decision making.
PG  - 333-49
AB  - Prior studies suggest that knowledge and attitudes of health care professionals 
      influence patient communication and medical decision-making. To study this dynamic 
      in the context of genetic disability, we developed a survey on health professionals' 
      attitudes regarding disability and genetic screening and pilot-tested it on a sample 
      of medical students, residents, and genetic counseling students (N=85). Despite 
      minimal experience with disability or genetics, most respondents reported feeling 
      comfortable dealing with genetics (59%) and disability (75%). The majority felt that 
      disability caused significant suffering for both the person (51%) and family (64%), 
      and that research should be directed toward preventing genetic disability (62%). 
      Similar to prior literature, perceived "Quality of Life" was most often based on 
      degrees of physical and cognitive functioning, pain, and social support. However, 
      differences were found between genetic counseling trainees and other medical 
      trainees in their relative emphasis of social versus medical issues in questions of 
      disability and genetic testing, and these response patterns were associated with 
      differences in the groups' priorities for offering information about social 
      resources. Respondents agreed that access to genetic testing and information is 
      personal and that testing should be available upon request for oneself (68%) and to 
      a lesser degree for one's fetus (55%) or child (41%). However, the same individuals 
      frequently stated that society should regulate access to such technologies. Although 
      most felt that the patient and professional should jointly make such decisions on a 
      case-by-case basis, it was also seen as appropriate for the health care professional 
      to occasionally decline genetic testing. It seems appropriate that training and 
      experience influence knowledge and attitudes. Therefore, it is critical to document 
      knowledge and attitudes of various health care providers and trainees, including 
      differences between various specialties, to improve educational interventions geared 
      to this area.

TI  - Central neurological abnormalities and multiple chemical sensitivity caused by 
      chronic toluene exposure.
PG  - 479-82
AB  - Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is a syndrome in which multiple symptoms occur 
      with low-level chemical exposure; whether it is an organic disease initiated by 
      environmental exposure or a psychological disorder is still controversial. We report 
      a 38-year-old male worker with chronic toluene exposure who developed symptoms such 
      as palpitation, insomnia, dizziness with headache, memory impairment, euphoria while 
      working, and depression during the weekend. Upon cessation of exposure, follow-up 
      neurobehavioural tests, including the cognitive ability screening instrument and the 
      mini-mental state examination, gradually improved and eventually became normal. 
      Although no further toluene exposure was noted, non-specific symptoms reappeared 
      whenever the subject smelled automotive exhaust fumes or paint, or visited a petrol 
      station, followed by anxiety with sleep disturbance. During hospitalization for a 
      toluene provocation test, there was no difference between pre-challenge and 
      post-challenge PaCO(2), PaO(2), SaO(2) or pulmonary function tests, except some 
      elevation of pulse rate. The clinical manifestations suggested that MCS was more 
      relevant to psychophysiological than pathophysiological factors.

TI  - Effect of topical nasal corticosteroids on patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
      and rhinitis.
PG  - 423-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disabling illness of persistent 
      fatigue. Recent studies have shown that patients with CFS have an increased 
      prevalence of nonallergic rhinitis. Inflammation of the nasal passages due to 
      allergic rhinitis can cause nasal congestion resulting in an increased number of 
      sleep disturbances and daytime fatigue. While topical nasal corticosteroids have 
      been shown to alleviate nasal obstruction effectively in patients with rhinitis who 
      do not have CFS, it is unknown whether topical nasal corticosteroids will reduce CFS 
      symptoms. STUDY OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to determine whether topical 
      nasal corticosteroids will reduce daytime sleepiness in patients with CFS and 
      rhinitis. METHODS: Twenty-eight of 31 subjects with rhinitis and a diagnosis of CFS 
      completed the double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Two subjects 
      failed screening, and 3 subjects withdrew from the study prior to its completion. 
      Subjects were randomized according to Balaam's crossover design, and one of the 
      following interventions was used for each group in the study: 8-week treatment with 
      a topical nasal corticosteroid, 8-week treatment with a placebo saline spray, 4-week 
      treatment with a topical nasal corticosteroid followed by a 4-week treatment with a 
      placebo saline spray, or a 4-week treatment with a placebo saline spray followed by 
      a 4-week treatment with a topical nasal corticosteroid. Data focusing on rhinitis 
      symptoms, severity of chronic fatigue symptoms, and quality of life were gathered at 
      biweekly office visits and with daily diaries. RESULTS: The results indicated that 
      daytime sleepiness was reduced when patients with rhinitis and CFS were treated with 
      topical nasal corticosteroids. The severity of associated CFS symptoms, specifically 
      fatigue, muscle pain, postexertional fatigue, and daily activity, did not improve 
      with treatment. CONCLUSION: Treating the symptoms of rhinitis in patients with CFS 
      does not appear to alleviate daytime fatigue or associated nasal, musculoskeletal, 
      or cognitive complaints. Therefore, it is unlikely that aggressive treatment of such 
      symptoms with topical nasal corticosteroids will provide significant benefit to 
      patients with CFS who do not have allergic rhinitis. These results indicate that the 
      nonallergic rhinitis seen in patients with CFS may arise from a mechanism other than 
      chronic inflammation.

TI  - Screening for ability to complete a questionnaire: a preliminary evaluation of the 
      AbilityQ and ShoulderQ for assessing shoulder pain in stroke patients.
PG  - 150-7
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the repeatability of the AbilityQ--a screening tool to assess 
      technical ability to complete a questionnaire--in patients with complex disabilities 
      following stroke. To evaluate the validity of the AbilityQ in predicting 
      repeatability and consistency of response to verbal and visual analogue scale 
      questions in the ShoulderQ in those with shoulder pain. DESIGN: In a cross-sectional 
      study, the AbilityQ and 'ShoulderQ' were administered on two consecutive days by a 
      single investigator. SETTING: Six regional rehabilitation centres in the UK managing 
      patients with severe complex neurological disability. SUBJECTS: Forty-nine patients 
      with anterior or posterior circulation strokes: 13 (63%) had cognitive deficits and 
      28 (57%) had communicative deficits. RESULTS: Thirty-one (63.3%) patients required 
      some degree of help in completing the AbilityQ. Percentage agreement for individual 
      questions between day 1 and day 2 ranged from 55 to 88% with kappa values from 0.07 
      to 0.79. Repeatability of ShoulderQ responses was 36-72% for the verbal questions 
      (kappa values 0.16-0.56). For visual analogue scale (VAS) questions, agreement +/- 1 
      on a 10-point scale was 36-59% with intraclass correlation coefficients 0.50-0.60 (p 
      < 0.01). High verbal (> or = 3/4) and VAS scores (3/3) on the AbilityQ had positive 
      predictive values for good repeatability in the ShoulderQ of 80% and 58% 
      respectively. Mismatched AbilityQ responses to verbal and VAS questions showed a 
      positive predictive value of 92% for similar inconsistency in the ShoulderQ and a 
      negative predictive value of 90%. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary evaluation the 
      AbilityQ and the ShoulderQ each demonstrated a moderate level of repeatability in a 
      group of patients expected to have difficulty in completing questionnaires. The 
      AbilityQ appears to have some clinical usefulness in identifying those able to 
      respond to the ShoulderQ and, where responses to verbal and VAS questions conflict, 
      may offer some guidance as to which are most likely to be accurate in that 
      individual. Further development is underway.

AB  - The comorbidity of headache and depression is rarely studied in the elderly. 
      Confounders were seldom controlled in previous studies. From August 1993 to March 
      1994, we conducted a door-to-door survey to investigate the relationship of headache 
      and depression in a Chinese elderly population (age > or = 65 years old) in two 
      townships of Kinmen, Taiwan. A total of 1421 participants (71%) out of 2003 eligible 
      citizens completed five measurements: a structured headache interview, Geriatric 
      Depression Scale-short form (GDS-S), a survey of chronic medical illness. Cognitive 
      Abilities Screening Instrument and an evaluation of activities of daily living. 
      Headache diagnoses were made according to the criteria of the International Headache 
      Society (IHS), 1988. Depression was defined as a GDS-S score > or = 8. After 
      adjustment for confounding, subjects with more frequent headaches, more severe 
      headaches, diagnoses of IHS migraine or chronic tension-type headaches in the past 
      year, or a lifetime history of any headache including migraine were more likely to 
      be depressed. In addition, the most relevant headache-related predictors of 
      depression were the presence of any reported lifetime headache (odds ratio (OR) = 
      1.8, P < 0.01) and headache frequency > or = 7 days/month in the past year (OR = 
      2.0, P = 0.01). This study provided evidence that headache is independently 
      associated with depression in the elderly. A high comorbidity of depression was 
      found in the elderly with IHS migraine or chronic tension-type headaches. Not only 
      the headache profile in the past year but also that in their lifetime was important 
      in predicting current depression in the elderly. 1

TI  - An investigation into the drawing skills of aphasic adults.
PG  - 218-23
AB  - A matched-pairs design was used to explore differences between drawings made by 
      chronic aphasic people and their non-aphasic peers. Standardised and novel 
      assessments of drawing skill were made and aphasic peoples' drawings found to be 
      significantly different for four factors--placement, complexity, perspective and 
      size. This is discussed using a cognitive neuropsychological framework for drawing 
      production. The Short Aphasia Screening Test (Whurr, 1996) was a significant 
      predictor of drawing performance, indicating its usefulness in client selection for 
      drawing-based interventions. Assessment and facilitation of drawing, factors of age, 
      severity and laterality are also discussed.

TI  - Neurology and the kidney.
PG  - 810-21
AB  - Renal failure is relatively common, but except in association with spina bifida or 
      paraplegia it is unlikely to occur as a result of disease of the CNS. Renal failure, 
      however, commonly affects the nervous system. The effects of kidney failure on the 
      nervous system are more pronounced when failure is acute. In addition to the 
      important problems related to renal failure there are both acquired and genetically 
      determined diseases which may affect the kidney and the brain. Those acquired 
      diseases include the vasculitides, the paraproteinaemias, and various granulomatous 
      conditions (considered in other chapters of Neurology and Medicine). In two of the 
      most commonly encountered genetically determined diseases, Von Hippel-Lindau disease 
      and polycystic kidney disease, location of pathogenic mutations will provide 
      improved screening programmes and, possibly, allow therapeutic intervention. Uraemia 
      may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas the clinical 
      features of uraemia are well documented, the pathophysiology is less well understood 
      and probably multifactorial. Uraemic encephalopathy, which classically fluctuates, 
      is associated with problems in cognition and memory and may progress to delirium, 
      convulsions, and coma. The encephalopathy may initially worsen with periods of 
      dialysis and almost certainly relates to altered metabolic states in association 
      with ionic changes and possibly impaired synaptic function. Renal failure may affect 
      the peripheral nervous system, resulting in a neuropathy which shows a predilection 
      for large diameter axons. This may be reversed by dialysis and transplantation. The 
      myopathy seen in renal failure, often associated with bone pain and tenderness, is 
      similar to that encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. 
      Dialysis itself is associated with neurological syndromes including the 
      dysequilibrium syndrome, subdural haematoma, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dialysis 
      dementia, which was prevalent during the 1970s, has reduced in frequency with the 
      use of aluminium free dialysate. With the introduction of transplantation and the 
      concomitant use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs, the pattern of neurological 
      problems encountered in renal replacement therapy has shifted. Five per cent of 
      patients develop nerve injuries during renal transplantation, and up to 40% of 
      patients experience neurological side effects from cyclosporine. Furthermore, CNS 
      infections, often fungal in type, have been reported in up to 45% of transplant 
      patients coming to postmortem. The nature of the involvement of neurologists with 
      their nephrology colleagues is therefore evolving.

TI  - Screening and Neuropsychological Assessment of Spray Painters at Risk for Organic 
      Solvent Neurotoxicity.
PG  - 286-293
AB  - The aim of this study was twofold: 1) To examine the usefulness of the screening 
      Questionnaire 16 (Q16) in relation to Type 2 organic solvent neurotoxicity (OSN). 
      Type 2 OSN is defined by chronic exposure to neurotoxic solvents and symptoms of 
      neurotoxocity, and is divided into Type 2A, characterized by sustained personality 
      or mood change, and Type 2B, characterized by impairment in intellectual function. 
      2) To determine the sensitivities of a number of neuropsychological tests in the 
      assessment of OSN. Subjects of the study were 20 spray painters with high Q16 scores 
      and two control groups-20 spray painters with low Q16 scores, and ten nonexposed 
      panel beaters (aged 23-53 years). The subjects were given psychological and 
      neuropsychological assessments by a psychologist blind to their Q16 status. Seven of 
      the 20 men with high Q16 scores had significant numbers of both neuropsychological 
      and psychological symptoms, with an additional four having small numbers of 
      cognitive symptoms only. Men who had low Q16 scores did not have enough symptoms to 
      indicate clear OSN, although eight men in this group had small numbers of depressed 
      neuropsychological test scores. A MANOVA on individual tests demonstrated that 
      single tests failed to discriminate the groups at the 0.05 level. The results 
      suggest that the Q16 effectively screens men with clear Type 2 OSN, most of whom 
      have both psychological and neuropsychological symptoms. It is less reliable for 
      screening men with few neuropsychological deficits. Those tests most sensitive to 
      the neuropsychological symptoms of OSN are Digit Symbol, the Rey Osterreith Complex 
      Figure, and the California Verbal Learning Test. The results of the study do not 
      provide strong support for the division of Type 2 OSN into Type 2A and Type 2B OSN.

      analgesia opioid.
PG  - 356-60
AB  - This study evaluated the safety and cognitive impact of patient-controlled analgesia 
      with fentanyl compared to patient-controlled analgesia with morphine among elderly 
      postoperative patients. In addition, two screening tests for cognitive impairment, 
      the Mini Mental Status Exam and the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, were 
      compared. Ninety-six elderly patients were randomly allocated to receive 
      patient-controlled analgesia with either fentanyl or morphine following hip or knee 
      arthroplasty. Patients were evaluated postoperatively for clinical confusion, 
      cognitive function test results, adequacy of analgesia, drug use and complications. 
      Fentanyl produced less depression in postoperative cognitive function compared to 
      morphine. The incidence of clinical confusion was not statistically different 
      between groups (4.3% for fentanyl versus 14.3% for morphine). Fentanyl patients used 
      more opioid based on a dose ratio of 100:1 suggesting that this dose ratio is 
      inadequate. The incidence of urinary retention was lower in the fentanyl group. A 
      poor agreement between the two tests of cognitive impairment mandates caution when 
      peri-operative cognitive function is compared using different tests.

AB  - The authors investigated the relation between psychopathology in medically ill 
      inpatients and use and cost of medical care services. Of 455 medical inpatients, the 
      Medical Inpatient Screening Test identified 27.9% as very depressed, 27.5% as very 
      anxious, 20.2% as having cognitive dysfunction, and 8.6% as having high pain levels. 
      Overall, the test identified 51% of the patients as having high levels of 
      psychopathology or pain. These subjects had a 40% longer median length of hospital 
      stay and 35% greater mean hospital costs than those with low levels of 
      psychopathology or pain. Patients with greater psychopathology also had higher 
      hospital charges, more procedures during hospitalization, and more discharge 
      diagnoses but did not differ from the other patients in sex, race, age, 
      diagnosis-related group (DRG) major diagnostic category, or DRG weight.

      associated with a characteristic affective coloration described as "bittersweet". It 
      is concluded that the locales remembered are displacements from objects whose 
      representation was repressed. Nostalgia is a ubiquitous human experience that is 
      evoked by particular stimuli under special circumstances and, while it is generally 
      a normal occurrence, pathological forms occur. Among those discussed are: nostalgia 
      as a substitute for mourning, as an attempted mastery through idealization and 
      displacement of a painful past, as a resistance in analysis, and as a counterphobic 
      mechanism. Nostalgia not only serves as a screen memory, but may also be said to 
      operate as a screen affect.

TI  - Risk Factors for Delirium in Older Adults in the Emergency Department: A Systematic 
      Review and Meta-Analysis.

LID - 10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.03.005 [doi]
AB  - We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify risk factors for 
      delirium in geriatric patients in the emergency department and to identify emergency 
      department (ED)-based modifiable risk factors for developing delirium during 
      hospitalization. We searched evidence based medicine reviews, EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
      Scopus, and Web of Science for observational studies from the time of their 
      inception to July 2020. We included studies that evaluated potential risk factors 
      for either prevalent or incident delirium among older adults (age ≥ 60 years) 
      presenting to the ED. When appropriate, we meta-analyzed estimates for risk factors 
      using a random-effects model. The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the 
      grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation approach. The 
      study's protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CDR42020175261). A total of 4,513 
      citations were reviewed, and 34 studies met the criteria for inclusion: 27 
      evaluating risk factors for ED delirium (13,412 patients) and 7 evaluating ED-based 
      risk factors for developing delirium during hospitalization (2,238 patients). The 
      prevalence of ED delirium ranged from 7% to 35%. Four factors had strong 
      associations with ED delirium and were graded as high-certainty evidence, including 
      nursing home residence (4 studies; odds ratio [OR], 3.45; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI], 2.17 to 5.48), cognitive impairment (7 studies; OR, 4.46; 95% CI, 3.38 to 
      5.89), hearing impairment (3 studies, OR, 2.57; 95% CI, 1.03 to 6.41), and a history 
      of stroke (3 studies; OR, 3.20; 95% CI, 1.17 to 8.75). The rate of developing 
      delirium during hospitalization ranged from 11% to 27%. A length of stay of more 
      than 10 hours in ED was associated with a higher risk of delirium (1 study; OR, 
      2.23; 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.41). One study reported that severe pain, rather than the 
      use of opioids, was associated with the development of delirium. These findings can 
      be used to prioritize delirium screening in the ED and develop novel ED delirium 
      risk scores or prevention interventions.

TI  - Diagnostic accuracy of gray scale muscle ultrasound screening for pediatric 
      neuromuscular disease.
PG  - 50-58
LID - 10.1002/mus.27211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gray scale ultrasound (US) has been demonstrated to be a sensitive and 
      specific tool in the diagnosis of pediatric neuromuscular disease (NMD). With recent 
      advances in genetic testing, the diagnostic work up for NMD has evolved. The purpose 
      of this study was to compare the current diagnostic value of gray scale US to 
      previously defined sensitivities and specificities to determine when this test can 
      add value to a patient's diagnostic workup. METHODS: Standardized quantitative gray 
      scale US imaging was performed on 148 pediatric patients presenting for 
      electrodiagnostic testing to evaluate for NMD. Patients were categorized as having 
      an NMD, a non-NMD, or as "uncertain." The US results were defined as normal, 
      borderline or abnormal based on echointensity values. Sensitivity, specificity, 
      positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of 
      the test were calculated. RESULTS: Forty-five percent of the patients had an NMD, 
      54% a non-NMD, and in 1% the diagnosis remained uncertain. US was abnormal in 73% of 
      myopathies, 63% of neuromuscular junction disorders, 60% of generalized neuropathies 
      and 58% of focal neuropathies. After excluding patients in whom muscle US was not 
      expected to be abnormal (eg, sensory neuropathy), sensitivity was 83%, specificity 
      79%, PPV 75%, NPV 86%, and accuracy 81%. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative gray scale muscle 
      US still has good diagnostic value as a screening tool in pediatric NMD. As with any 
      diagnostic test, muscle US is best used in conjunction with history and physical 
      examination to increase specificity and diagnostic yield.

TI  - Quality of life, developmental milestones, and self-esteem of young adults with 
      congenital hypothyroidism diagnosed by neonatal screening.
PG  - 2654-61
LID - 10.1210/jc.2007-1560 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: With advances in the treatment of congenital hypothyroidism (CH), the 
      neuropsychological functioning of CH patients is considerably improved. Although 
      much is written about cognitive and motor development, little is known about 
      emotional and social consequences for patients growing up with CH, diagnosed by 
      neonatal screening. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the study were to: 1) compare 
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL), developmental milestones also called course 
      of life (CoL), sociodemographical outcomes, and self-esteem of CH patients with the 
      general population; and 2) explore whether severity of CH was related to these 
      outcomes. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: A total of 69 young adults with CH, born in The 
      Netherlands in 1981-1982, completed the "TNO-AZL Questionnaire for Adult's Health 
      related Quality of Life" questionnaire, the CoL survey (developmental milestones and 
      sociodemographical outcomes), and a self-esteem questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME 
      MEASURES: HRQoL, CoL, social demographical outcomes, and self-esteem in young adults 
      with CH were determined. RESULTS: CH patients are more often at risk for HRQoL 
      impairment and reported lower HRQoL on several domains (cognitive functioning, P < 
      0.0001; sleeping, P < 0.004; pain, P < 0.0001; daily activities, P < 0.004; 
      vitality, P < 0.0001; aggressiveness, P < 0.0001; and depressive moods, P < 0.0001) 
      compared with healthy adults. Patients reported a lower self-esteem (P < 0.005) and 
      had a delayed CoL on the domain of social development (P < 0.016). There were no 
      significant within-group differences between the severity groups for HRQoL, CoL, and 
      self-esteem. CONCLUSIONS: Negative consequences in terms of HRQoL, development, and 
      self-esteem are prevalent in young adults with CH. Health care physicians should be 
      attentive to these consequences and provide additional support (emotional and 
      educational guidance) if necessary.

TI  - Minimum geriatric screening tools to detect common geriatric problems.
PG  - 348-52
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health services for the elderly are becoming increasingly important in 
      industrialized nations, and comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is one of the 
      procedures designed to improve the health of this sector of the population. In 2003 
      a survey among Belgian geriatricians showed that despite the interest of the 
      geriatric teams for comprehensive geriatric assessment, it was not used enough. 
      Considering these results, as a first step, screening tools were proposed for the 
      main geriatric domains (Minimum Geriatric Screening Tools, MGST). OBJECTIVES: To 
      assess the feasibility of a MGST within the teams of geriatric units and to evaluate 
      the efficacy of a MGST on the detection rate of the geriatric problems of admitted 
      subjects. DESIGN: Prospective observational survey. METHODS: The teams were first 
      asked to encode active geriatric problems suspected according to their conventional 
      assessment. Then, in a second phase, a complete MGST was completed by the same team 
      within the first week after admission. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty six 
      registrations from 33 centres were available. Mean (+/- SD) number of screened 
      geriatric problems was 1.5 +/- 1.2 without MGST and 4.7 +/- 1.7 (p < 0.0001) using 
      the MGST. Except for the assessment for the risk of falls, the MGST leads to a 
      better screening for the seven other main geriatric domains (functional, continence, 
      cognition, depression, nutrition, pain, social). CONCLUSIONS: An improvement 
      associated with the use of simple minimal geriatric tools to screen geriatric 
      problems was evident. This approach has additional value for education and quality 
      assurance.

TI  - Program development and defining characteristics of returning military in a VA 
      Polytrauma Network Site.
PG  - 1027-34
AB  - The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have resulted in a new generation of combat 
      survivors with complex physical injuries and emotional trauma. This article reports 
      the initial implementation of the Polytrauma Network Site (PNS) clinic, which is a 
      key component of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Polytrauma System of Care 
      and serves military personnel returning from combat. The PNS clinic in Palo Alto, 
      California, is described to demonstrate the VA healthcare system's evolving effort 
      to meet the clinical needs of this population. We summarize the following features 
      of this interdisciplinary program: (1) sequential assessment, from initial traumatic 
      brain injury screening throughout our catchment area to evaluation by the PNS clinic 
      team, and (2) clinical evaluation results for the first 62 clinic patients. In 
      summary, this population shows a high prevalence of postconcussion symptoms, 
      posttraumatic stress, poor cognitive performance, head and back pain, auditory and 
      visual symptoms, and problems with dizziness or balance. An anonymous patient 
      feedback survey, which we used to fine-tune the clinic process, reflected high 
      satisfaction with this new program. We hope that the lessons learned at one site 
      will enhance the identification and treatment of veterans with polytrauma across the 
      country.

TI  - Assessment of the age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis 
      japonica.
PG  - 458-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis 
      japonica in China. METHODS: Between October 2004 and January 2005, residents from 
      two schistosome-endemic counties were screened for Schistosoma japonicum infection 
      using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Disability and morbidity were assessed 
      in seropositive individuals using the European quality of life questionnaire with an 
      additional cognitive dimension (known as the "EQ-5D plus") and ultrasonography. The 
      age-specific disability weight of chronic schistosomiasis was estimated based on 
      participants self-rated health scores on the visual analogue scale of the 
      questionnaire; the relationships between health status, morbidity and disability 
      weight were explored using multilevel regression models. FINDINGS: Of 2843 
      seropositive individuals, 1419 (49.9%) were classified as having chronic 
      schistosomiasis. Hepatomegaly was found in 76.3% (1082/1419); hepatic fibrosis was 
      found in 73.3% (1040/1419); and splenomegaly was found in 18.6% (264/1419). 
      Diarrhoea was the most common self-reported symptom (46.0%; 653/1419), followed by 
      abdominal pain (32.6%; 463/1419), impaired capacity to work or study (30.7%; 
      436/1419), and blood in the stool (11.1%; 157/1419). More than half of the 
      respondents reported impairments in at least one dimension of the EQ-5D plus 
      questionnaire, particularly pain or discomfort (47.9%; 675/1410) and anxiety or 
      depression (39.4%; 555/1410). The overall disability weight was 0.191, and 
      age-specific weights ranged from 0.095 among those aged 5-14 years to 0.246 among 
      those aged > 60 years. Multilevel regression models indicated that the disability 
      weight was significantly associated with the participants sex, grade of hepatic 
      fibrosis, the presence of hepatomegaly, abdominal pain, blood in the stool, impaired 
      capacity to work or study, and cognition. CONCLUSION: The disability weight 
      attributable to chronic schistosomiasis japonica is high and increases with age. Our 
      findings call for a reappraisal of the disability weights due to chronic 
      schistosomiasis mansoni and schistosomiasis haematobia as well as a re-estimation of 
      the global burden of schistosomiasis.

TI  - Neurology of Fabry disease.
PG  - 436-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fabry disease has diverse neurological manifestations, many of which 
      influence morbidity and quality of life. AIMS: The aim of the study was to document 
      the clinical and subclinical neurological manifestations in a cohort of Australian 
      patients with Fabry disease, using multiple clinical tools and a multidisciplinary 
      approach. METHODS: Participants completed focused questionnaires and underwent 
      clinical neurological examination, Neurocognitive testing using Mini Mental State 
      Examination and Neuropsychiatry Unit Cognitive Screen, Quantitative Sensory Testing 
      (QST), autonomic assessment using RR interval variation, intracranial magnetic 
      resonance imaging (MRI) and audiology. In subsets of patients who had previously 
      undergone QST and/or prospective serial quality-of-life assessments over the 
      previous 5 years, results before and after enzyme replacement therapy were compared. 
      RESULTS: Twenty hemizygotes and two heterozygotes were recruited. The age (mean +/- 
      standard deviation (SD)) of male participants was 40.4 +/- 11.9 years (range 20-62 
      years); the women were aged between 20 and 56 years. Increasing age was strongly 
      associated with increasing neurological disability. Clinical peripheral neuropathy 
      predominantly affected thermal sensation in all patients, with variable involvement 
      of pinprick and light touch. QST confirmed these findings. Clinical cerebellar tests 
      were commonly abnormal: this has not been previously reported in the absence of 
      symptomatic cerebrovascular disease. There was hearing loss was in 90% of patients 
      and no patient older than 44 years had normal hearing. MRI lesion prevalence 
      increased with age. Despite neurological complications being common, formal 
      cognitive testing was basically normal. QST thresholds for pain showed a significant 
      change after enzyme replacement therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Neurological complications in 
      Fabry disease are common, complex and may be devastating. All patients studied had 
      neurological involvement, with protean and diverse manifestations.

TI  - Evaluation of item candidates: the PROMIS qualitative item review.
PG  - S12-21
AB  - One of the PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System) 
      network's primary goals is the development of a comprehensive item bank for 
      patient-reported outcomes of chronic diseases. For its first set of item banks, 
      PROMIS chose to focus on pain, fatigue, emotional distress, physical function, and 
      social function. An essential step for the development of an item pool is the 
      identification, evaluation, and revision of extant questionnaire items for the core 
      item pool. In this work, we also describe the systematic process wherein items are 
      classified for subsequent statistical processing by the PROMIS investigators. Six 
      phases of item development are documented: identification of extant items, item 
      classification and selection, item review and revision, focus group input on domain 
      coverage, cognitive interviews with individual items, and final revision before 
      field testing. Identification of items refers to the systematic search for existing 
      items in currently available scales. Expert item review and revision was conducted 
      by trained professionals who reviewed the wording of each item and revised as 
      appropriate for conventions adopted by the PROMIS network. Focus groups were used to 
      confirm domain definitions and to identify new areas of item development for future 
      PROMIS item banks. Cognitive interviews were used to examine individual items. Items 
      successfully screened through this process were sent to field testing and will be 
      subjected to innovative scale construction procedures.

TI  - Distress screening in a multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic: prevalence and 
      predictors of clinically significant distress.
PG  - 215-24
AB  - Screening for distress in cancer patients is recommended by the National 
      Comprehensive Cancer Network, and a Distress Thermometer has previously been 
      developed and empirically validated for this purpose. The present study sought to 
      determine the rates and predictors of distress in a sample of patients being seen in 
      a multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic. Consecutive patients (N=333) were recruited 
      from an outpatient multidisciplinary lung cancer clinic to complete the Distress 
      Thermometer, an associated Problem Symptom List, and two questions about interest in 
      receiving help for symptoms. Over half (61.6%) of patients reported distress at a 
      clinically significant level, and 22.5% of patients indicated interest in receiving 
      help with their distress and/or symptoms. Problems in the areas of family 
      relationships, emotional functioning, lack of information about diagnosis/treatment, 
      physical functioning, and cognitive functioning were associated with higher reports 
      of distress. Specific symptoms of depression, anxiety, pain and fatigue were most 
      predictive of distress. Younger age was also associated with higher levels of 
      distress. Distress was not associated with other clinical variables, including stage 
      of illness or medical treatment approach. Similar results were obtained when 
      individuals who had not yet received a definitive diagnosis of lung cancer (n=134) 
      were excluded from analyses; however, family problems and anxiety were no longer 
      predictive of distress. Screening for distress in a multidisciplinary lung cancer 
      clinic is feasible and a significant number of patients can be expected to meet 
      clinical criteria for distress. Results also highlight younger age and specific 
      physical and psychosocial symptoms as predictive of clinically significant distress. 
      Identification of the presence and predictors of distress are the first steps toward 
      appropriate referral and treatment of symptoms and problems that contribute to 
      cancer patients' distress.

TI  - Screening for cognitive impairment and depression in ethnically diverse older 
      populations.
PG  - 275-8
AB  - Considerable advances have been made over the past decade in developing and adapting 
      instruments to measure cognitive functioning in individuals with a wide range of 
      educational and racial/ethnic backgrounds in different countries. Similar approaches 
      can be used to extend these assessments to groups that have not yet been studied. 
      The critical issues are to ensure that methods are appropriately harmonized to the 
      local context, that local norms are established, and that local expertise is brought 
      to bear in instrument development/adaptation. Effective instruments are also 
      available to screen for depression in the elderly but closer attention should be 
      made to possible ethnic differences in item response on these scales. The ideal 
      screening tool should be quick, inexpensive, painless, and socially/culturally 
      acceptable to the population. It should also have desirable psychometric properties. 
      Examples are provided from several international studies. The context, costs, and 
      objectives of screening a given population should be considered when selecting a 
      screening instrument and a threshold on the scale, whether for clinical or research 
      purposes.

TI  - The oral health assessment tool--validity and reliability.
PG  - 191-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Oral Health Assessment Tool (OHAT) was a component of the Best 
      Practice Oral Health Model for Australian Residential Care study. The OHAT provided 
      institutional carers with a simple, eight category screening tool to assess 
      residents' oral health, including those with dementia. This analysis presents OHAT 
      reliability and validity results. METHODS: A convenience sample of 21 residential 
      care facilities (RCFs) in urban and rural Victoria, NSW and South Australia used the 
      OHAT at baseline, three-months and six-months to assess intra- and inter-carer 
      reliability and concurrent validity. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty five residents 
      completed all study phases. Intra-carer reliability for OHAT categories: percent 
      agreement ranged from 74.4 per cent for oral cleanliness, to 93.9 per cent for 
      dental pain; Kappa statistics were in moderate range (0.51-0.60) for lips, saliva, 
      oral cleanliness, and for all other categories in range of 0.61-0.80 (substantial 
      agreement) (p < 0.05). Inter-carer reliability for OHAT categories: percent 
      agreement ranged from 72.6 per cent for oral cleanliness to 92.6 per cent for dental 
      pain; Kappa statistics were in moderate range (0.48-0.60) for lips, tongue, gums, 
      saliva, oral cleanliness, and for all other categories in range of 0.61-0.80 
      (substantial agreement) (p < 0.05). Intraclass correlation coefficients for OHAT 
      total scores were 0.78 for intra-carer and 0.74 for inter-carer reliability. 
      Validity analyses of the OHAT categories and examination findings showed complete 
      agreement for the lips category, with the natural teeth, dentures, and tongue 
      categories having high significant correlations and percent agreements. The gums 
      category had significant moderate correlation and percent agreement. Non-significant 
      and low correlations and percent agreements were evident for the saliva, oral 
      cleanliness and dental pain categories. CONCLUSION: The Oral Health Assessment Tool 
      was evaluated as being a reliable and valid screening assessment tool for use in 
      residential care facilities, including those with cognitively impaired residents.

TI  - Factors associated with self- and caregiver report of pain among community-dwelling 
      persons with dementia.
PG  - 567-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among cognitively intact patients, self- and caregiver report of patient 
      pain has been associated with worse psychological health for both the patient and 
      caregiver. Little existing research examines factors associated with patient 
      self-report of pain and caregiver report of patient pain among community-dwelling 
      persons with dementia. OBJECTIVE: To identify patient and caregiver factors 
      associated with self- and caregiver report of patient pain among community-dwelling 
      persons with dementia. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal study 
      using structured interviews with dementia patients and their family caregivers. 
      SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Urban outpatient geriatrics clinics affiliated with a 
      university hospital. Dyads composed of dementia patients and their family caregivers 
      were approached prior to routine clinic visits to participate in the study. 
      MEASUREMENTS: Relevant patient measurements included self-report of pain; cognitive, 
      functional, and comorbidity assessments; a screen for depression; and demographic 
      information. Relevant caregiver measurements included their report of patient pain 
      and agitation, screens for depression and strain, and demographic information. 
      RESULTS: Of 115 dyads, 37 patients (32%) and 57 caregivers (53%) reported the 
      patient to be in pain. No patient or caregiver factors were significantly associated 
      with patient self-report of pain. In the univariate analysis, caregiver reports of 
      patient pain were associated with the patient not being depressed (p = .036), 
      caregiver reports of patient agitation (p = .038), higher level of education in the 
      caregiver (p = .029), and caregiver depression (p = .019). In multivariate logistic 
      regression analyses, caregiver depression and patient agitation remained 
      significantly associated with caregiver report of patient pain. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      community-dwelling persons with dementia, self-report of pain was not associated 
      with any other variables measured, suggesting that pain should be assessed through 
      direct self-report and treated accordingly. Caregiver report of patient pain was 
      associated with both caregiver report of patient agitation and caregiver depression. 
      These findings suggest that clinicians may need to routinely assess patient pain, 
      patient agitation, and caregiver depression. More research is needed to understand 
      the relationship between these conditions.

TI  - Perception of health-related quality of life and psychological status in oldest 
      hospitalized patients without cognitive impairment.
PG  - 75-84
AB  - The most diffuse questionnaires on health-related quality of life (HRQL) and/or 
      psychological status (PS) consider all subjects older than 74 years, for normative 
      reference values, in a single group without any further separation for age decades. 
      Their authors assume that there are no further age-related differences, since older 
      patients had a severely limited autonomy and lose the capacity of grading the 
      severity of the diseases they are affected. Healthy subjects older than 80, without 
      mental impairment (WMI) present an acceptable HRQL, PS and a perception of health 
      status. No data are available on the oldest patients, carrying chronic diseases, 
      admitted to hospital departments for acute health problems.We collected 46 WMI 
      oldest patients (>/= 80 years), admitted for such troubles. They were investigated 
      by the mini mental state examination (MMSE) and, in random order, the Nottingham 
      health profile (NHP) and the psychological general well-being instrument(PGWBI). 
      Clinical data recordings were carried out by the medical personnel, using 
      standardized forms. The value of any individual domain of each patient was compared 
      to the age - (>/=75-year) and sex-matched control group derived from two large 
      Italian population studies, using the Z-score. Charlson's comorbidity index, the 
      index of coexistent disease (ICED), and the cumulative illness rating scale (CIRS) 
      were also calculated. Patients older than 80 did show difference in NHP domains in 
      comparison with normative values only for social isolation, but presented 
      significantly worse Z-scores in all domains ofPGWBI. A relationship was observed 
      between number of daily medications and Z-scores of physical mobility and energy 
      (NHP). Similarly, vitality (PGWBI) correlated with all comorbidity indices, ICED 
      with positive well-being (PGWBI), pain (NHP) with CIRS subscales. Hospitalized WMI 
      oldest subjects maintain a HRQL quite comparable to normative group of subjects 
      older than 74 years. Furthermore, they showed a preserved correct perception of 
      factors/diseases that possibly affect their psychological status and autonomy.

TI  - Diversity matters: Unique populations of women and breast cancer screening.
PG  - 2300-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethnic differences in breast cancer screening behaviors are well 
      established. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding exactly what causes 
      these differences and which characteristics in low-screening populations should be 
      targeted in an effort to modify screening behavior. METHODS: Stratified cluster 
      sampling was used to recruit 1364 women (ages 50-70 years) from 6 ethnic groups: 
      African-American women; U.S.-born white women; English-speaking Caribbean, Haitian, 
      and Dominican women; and immigrant Eastern-European women. In interviews, 
      respondents provided information concerning demographic and structural variables 
      related to mammogram utilization (age, education, income, marital status, physician 
      recommendation, access, and insurance) and a set of cognitive variables (fatalism, 
      perception of personal risk, health beliefs concerning cancer) and socioemotional 
      variables (stress, cancer worry, embarrassment, and pain). RESULTS: For data 
      analysis, the authors used a 2-step logistic regression with frequency of mammograms 
      over a 10-year period (< or = 4 mammograms over 10 years or > or = 5 mammograms over 
      10 years) as a dependent variable. U.S.-born African-American women and Dominican 
      women were screened as frequently as European-American women, but the remaining 
      minority groups were screened with less frequency. With one exception, ethnicity 
      ceased to predict screening frequency once cognitive and emotional variables were 
      controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Although women from clearly operationalized ethnic groups 
      continue to screen at rates substantially below those of the majority groups, these 
      differences appear to be explained substantially by differences in psychologic 
      variables. This is encouraging because, rather than targeting culture for 
      intervention, variables can be targeted that are amenable to change, such as 
      emotions and beliefs.

TI  - Patient-controlled analgesia for the pediatric patient.
PG  - 298-304; quiz 305-6
AB  - Pediatric patients benefit from patient-controlled analgesia (PCA), which eliminates 
      the need for painful intramuscular injections of opioids and improves the child's 
      sense of control. Age is often used inappropriately as a criterion for PCA use in 
      children. Children must be carefully screened for their cognitive and physical 
      ability to manage their pain using PCA. Family-controlled analgesia and 
      nurse-controlled analgesia may be considered in select cases as alternatives to PCA 
      in children with cognitive or physical disabilities. PCA dosage regimens must be 
      individualized on the basis of age. Monitoring parameters must be age appropriate. 
      Potential adverse effects of PCA therapy, including respiratory depression, nausea, 
      vomiting, and pruritus, can be prevented or controlled. Clinicians must become aware 
      of age-related and developmental differences in the pharmacokinetic, 
      pharmacodynamic, and monitoring parameters for the pediatric patient. The safety and 
      efficacy of PCA in pediatric patients has been established, and its role has 
      increased beyond postoperative pain management.

TI  - My mind is as clear as it used to be: A pilot study illustrating the difficulties of 
      employing a single-item subjective screen to detect cognitive impairment in 
      outpatients with cancer.
PG  - 705-15
AB  - Oncology patients often complain that their "mind does not seem to be clear." This 
      subjective perception, sometimes referred to as "chemo brain," may be due to 
      situational stressors, psychological disorders, organic factors, or effects of 
      neurotoxic medications. Cognitive decline cannot only diminish quality of life, but 
      can also interfere with a patient's ability to make decisions regarding complex 
      treatment issues. The current study investigated the utility of using item 11 of the 
      Zung Self-Rating Depression Screen (ZSDS) as a cognitive screen. A sample of 61 
      ambulatory cancer patients completed this study. Participants were recruited from 
      four sites of Community Cancer Care, Inc., in Indiana. A battery of cognitive 
      instruments and psychosocial inventories was administered in a standardized order. 
      The sample had a mean age of 58.6 years and comprised 57.4% (n=35) women and 42.6% 
      (n=26) men. Item 11 of the ZSDS was not significantly correlated to the cognitive 
      measures. Correlates of the perception of cognitive impairment were the Dementia 
      Rating Scale (DRS) Attention Scale (r=-0.26, P<0.05) and the ZSDS total score 
      (r=-0.29, P<0.05). Patients' perceptions of having a cognitive impairment determined 
      by item 11 of the ZSDS was predicted by total score on the ZSDS (F=42.5, P<0.001), 
      age (F=26.0, P<0.001), and score on the Stroop test (F=19.8, P<0.001). Analysis of 
      sensitivity and specificity indicated that the single-item screen used in this study 
      is not an accurate means for identifying oncology patients with actual cognitive 
      impairment. We conclude that while the perception of cognitive impairment is common 
      in cancer patients, there may be problems in interpreting the nature of these 
      complaints, particularly in separating them from depressive preoccupation.

TI  - Cancer-related fatigue. Clinical practice guidelines in oncology.
PG  - 308-31
AB  - These guidelines propose a treatment algorithm in which patients are evaluated 
      regularly for fatigue using a brief screening instrument, and are treated as 
      indicated by their fatigue level. The algorithm's goal is to identify and treat all 
      patients with fatigue that causes distress or interferes with their daily activities 
      or functioning. Management of fatigue begins with primary oncology team members who 
      perform the initial screening and either provide basic education and counseling or 
      expand the initial screening to a more focused evaluation for moderate or higher 
      levels of fatigue. At this point the patient is assessed for current disease and 
      treatment status, a review of body systems, and an in-depth fatigue evaluation. In 
      addition, the patient is assessed for the presence of seven treatable factors known 
      to contribute to fatigue: pain, emotional distress, sleep disturbance, anemia, 
      alterations in nutrition, deconditioning, and comorbidities. If any of these 
      conditions are present, they should be treated according to practice guidelines, 
      with referral to other care professionals as appropriate, and the patient's fatigue 
      should be reevaluated regularly. If none of the seven factors are present or the 
      fatigue is unresolved, selection of appropriate fatigue management and treatment 
      strategies is considered within the context of the patient's clinical status: 
      receiving active cancer treatment, receiving disease-free long-term follow-up, or 
      receiving care at the end of life. Management of fatigue is cause-specific when 
      conditions known to cause fatigue can be identified and treated. When specific 
      causes, such as infection, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction, 
      cannot be identified and corrected, nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of 
      the fatigue should be considered. Nonpharmacologic interventions may include a 
      moderate exercise program to improve functional capacity and activity tolerance, 
      psychosocial programs to manage stress and increase support, restorative therapies 
      to decrease cognitive alterations and improve mood state, and nutritional and sleep 
      interventions for patients with disturbances in eating or sleeping. Pharmacologic 
      therapy may include drugs, such as antidepressants for depression or erythropoietin 
      for anemia. A few clinical reports of the use of psychostimulants suggest the need 
      for further research on these agents as potential treatment modalities in managing 
      fatigue. Effective management of cancer-related fatigue involves an informed and 
      supportive oncology care team that assesses patients' fatigue levels regularly and 
      systematically, educates and counsels patients regarding strategies for coping with 
      fatigue, and uses institutional fatigue management experts for referral of patients 
      with unresolved fatigue.

      answering survey questions are not the object of this kind of test. METHODS: 
      Cognitive survey methods were used here to test a questionnaire screening for 
      rehabilitation needs in people suffering from back pain. Essential techniques of 
      cognitive testing (think-aloud, probing, confidence ratings) are outlined. We 
      applied these techniques to 20 patients suffering from either acute or chronic back 
      pain in order to test the survey. RESULTS: The main goal, i.e., identifying problems 
      in item formulation by means of cognitive testing, was achieved. Almost one third of 
      the survey questions were rephrased according to the results of the study. Some of 
      the improvements of the questionnaire are illustrated. CONCLUSIONS: The increased 
      effort required to perform cognitive testing as compared to traditional pretesting 
      pays off. The two methods have specific pros and cons and cannot replace one 
      another.

TI  - Psychological evaluation of patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia syndrome: a 
      comprehensive approach.
PG  - 219-33
AB  - Symptoms of FMS are extremely distressing, and currently there is no cure or any 
      treatment capable of substantially reducing all symptoms for all patients. 
      Rehabilitation goals include improving emotional functioning, physical functioning, 
      and quality of life. In light of these goals, psychological screening is an 
      essential component of any comprehensive FMS evaluation. In many cases, the high 
      levels of emotional distress, disability, and reduced quality of life noted in these 
      patients warrants a more thorough psychological evaluation [11]. A comprehensive 
      psychological evaluation is complex, involves exploration of a broad range of areas, 
      and should be administered by an experienced health psychologist. The primary 
      objective of this evaluation is to delineate emotional, cognitive, and behavioral 
      factors involved in persistent pain, suffering, and disability, with an emphasis on 
      the prescription of appropriate interventions for altering maladaptive patterns. The 
      results of the psychological evaluation involve a synthesis of information and 
      should assist in developing a list of behavioral problems that contribute to the 
      maintenance and exacerbation of [table: see text] suffering and disability. 
      Information obtained should facilitate treatment planning, specifically the matching 
      of treatment components to the needs of individual patients.

TI  - Posttraumatic stress symptomatology is associated with unexplained illness 
      attributed to Persian Gulf War military service.
PG  - 842-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Controversy exists concerning unexplained illness in Persian Gulf War 
      veterans, especially regarding the contribution of psychological trauma. We sought 
      to determine if war zone trauma or posttraumatic stress symptomatology (PTSS) are 
      associated with illnesses reported by Gulf War veterans that were documented by 
      medical examination but not attributable to a medical diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 
      1119 (55% response rate) of 2022 randomly sampled veterans of the United States 
      Persian Gulf War were screened and 237 cases and 113 controls were identified by 
      medical examination for a case-control study comparing Persian Gulf War military 
      veterans with or without medically documented, but unexplained, symptoms. 
      Multivariate logistic regression and cross-validation analyses examined self-report 
      measures of demographics, subjective physical symptoms and functioning, psychiatric 
      symptoms, stressors, war zone trauma, and PTSS, to identify correlates of 
      case-control status. RESULTS: Posttraumatic stress symptomatology and somatic 
      complaints were independently associated with case status, as were (although less 
      consistently) war zone trauma and depression. Age, education, and self-reported 
      health, stress-related somatization, pain, energy/fatigue, illness-related 
      functional impairment, recent stressors, and anxiety were univariate (but not 
      multivariate) correlates of case status. CONCLUSIONS: PTSS related to war zone 
      trauma warrants additional prospective research study and attention in clinical 
      screening and assessment as a potential contributor to the often debilitating 
      physical health problems experienced by Persian Gulf War veterans.

TI  - The detection of panic disorder in chest pain patients.
PG  - 323-32
AB  - The aims of this study were to 1) develop a detection model for recognizing panic 
      disorder (PD), 2) develop a simple questionnaire as a screening instrument for PD 
      detection, and 3) test in an outpatient cardiological chest pain population a 
      detection model for panic disorder previously described by Fleet et al. [20]. 
      Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore factors predictive of panic 
      disorder and to test the cross-cardiological setting constancy of the Fleet model in 
      199 chest pain patients without previously known heart disease referred to 
      cardiological outpatient investigation of chest pain. The SCL-90 somatization 
      subscale, Agoraphobia Cognitions Questionnaire, chest pain quality, pain 
      localization, and age were the best predictors of the presence of panic disorder. 
      This model correctly classified 78% of the subjects. The sum-score of a three-item 
      questionnaire correctly classified 74% of the subjects, while the previously 
      described model by Fleet et al. correctly classified 73% of the subjects. A 
      detection model and a screening questionnaire are proposed to improve the 
      recognition of PD in this chest pain population. This study partly supports the 
      cross-setting validity of a previously described detection model.

TI  - Stroke rehabilitation in nursing homes: how do we measure quality?
PG  - 869-84
AB  - Over one-third of Medicare stroke patients are admitted to nursing homes for 
      rehabilitation. Patients with stroke who are admitted to nursing homes are extremely 
      heterogeneous, including both those with minimal physical and cognitive impairment 
      and those who are totally physically dependent. Quality measures that are 
      appropriate for evaluating stroke care in nursing homes include outcome measures, 
      particularly those that are patient-centered, such as self-reported functional 
      recovery and return to the community; process measures involving essential services 
      such as screening for depression and pain; and structural measures such as the 
      availability of a psychologist or presence of an interdisciplinary team. In 
      measuring quality, nursing home professionals must allow sufficient time for 
      outcomes to unfold, such as 3 to 6 months, rather than measuring outcome at 
      discharge from a setting. Nursing home professionals must also take into 
      consideration patient heterogeneity in terms of risk factors for outcomes of 
      interest.

TI  - The frequency of alcoholism among patients with pain due to terminal cancer.
PG  - 599-603
AB  - The purpose of this retrospective study was to determine the prevalence of 
      alcoholism among terminally ill cancer patients when assessed by multidisciplinary 
      interviews and by the CAGE Questionnaire. We reviewed the charts of 100 consecutive 
      patients assessed by a multidisciplinary team for the presence of alcoholism during 
      1989, and 100 consecutive patients assessed by the CAGE Questionnaire during 1992. 
      Alcoholism was diagnosed in 28/100 patients during 1989 (28%) and 18/66 patients 
      during 1992 (27%). Thirty-four patients were unable to complete the CAGE 
      Questionnaire in 1992 because of sedation or cognitive impairment; six of these 
      patients (17%) were found to be alcoholics after multidisciplinary assessment. Only 
      9/28 (32%) and 8/24 (33%) patients diagnosed as alcoholics during 1989 and 1992, 
      respectively, had been previously diagnosed as alcoholics according to the medical 
      charts. The mean equivalent daily dose of morphine during admission and on Day 2 
      during 1992 were 153 +/- 193 mg and 183 +/- 198 for alcoholic patients, versus 58 
      +/- 80 and 70 +/- 79 mg for nonalcoholics (P = 0.06 and 0.03, respectively). The 
      maximal dose of opioid and the pain intensity during admission, however, were not 
      significantly different between alcoholics and nonalcoholics. Our results suggest 
      that alcoholism is highly prevalent and underdiagnosed among symptomatic terminally 
      ill cancer patients. The CAGE Questionnaire should be used for screening for 
      alcoholism in this population. When multidimensional assessment and management of 
      pain is applied, the outcome of alcoholic patients appears to be similar to that of 
      nonalcoholics.

TI  - What does the BDI measure in chronic pain?
PG  - 259-266
LID - 10.1016/0304-3959(93)90155-I [doi]
AB  - The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) has been widely used to document the prevalence 
      of depressive symptomatology in samples of chronic pain patients and as an outcome 
      measure in studies of the psychological management of chronic pain. Several BDI 
      items have a somatic content (sleep disturbance, fatigue, etc). Since chronic pain 
      may have similar somatic effects, the significance of the total BDI score in this 
      population is unclear. Two hundred and forty mixed chronic pain patients completed 
      the BDI at screening interview for a psychologically based pain management 
      programme; of these, 207 (mean age 50.1 years; 63% female) were later admitted to 
      the programme when the BDI was readministered along with measures of pain, anxiety, 
      pain-related cognitions, and physical performance. The mean BDI score of the sample 
      was 18.1, with 71.7% meeting criteria (scoring 13 or more) for at least mild 
      depression. A principal-components analysis of the BDI yielded 3 meaningful factors 
      labelled: sadness about health, self-reproach, and somatic disturbance. Among the 
      most frequently endorsed items were those loading on the somatic factor. The pattern 
      of relationships between individual factor scores and measures of pain, mood, 
      cognition, and physical functioning indicated that the use of the total BDI score 
      may give a misleading impression of the nature and degree of affective disturbance 
      in this group of patients. The implications of these findings for our understanding 
      of BDI scores obtained by chronic pain patients are discussed.

TI  - Pain profiles of patients with nonorganic chest pain: a preliminary report of the 
      Multidimensional Pain Inventory.
PG  - 470-7
AB  - The primary purpose of this report is to extend the range of the Multidimensional 
      Pain Inventory (MPI) to include patients with nonorganic chest pain. Previous 
      research with the MPI has not included this patient population, although this 
      instrument has been used to derive an empirically based taxonomy of patient 
      responses to chronic pain. Scale scores are provided for a sample of 43 chest pain 
      patients and compared with normative scores from samples of chronic lower back pain 
      patients and patients suffering from temporomandibular disorder. The MPI taxonomy 
      was applicable for only 34.8% (N = 15) of this sample. Scale intercorrelations are 
      examined and compared with those derived during development of the MPI, to explore 
      reasons for this low classification rate. The results are discussed in light of 
      cognitive-behavioral factors present in persistent chest pain, with implications for 
      scale development and use of the MPI.

TI  - Hypnotic versus active cognitive strategies for alleviation of procedural distress 
      in pediatric oncology patients.
PG  - 181-91
AB  - This study provided a differential comparison of the efficacy of standardized 
      instruction in hypnosis or active cognitive strategy for provision of relief from 
      procedurally induced pain and anxiety. Subjects were instructed to self-direct in 
      the use of strategies during medical procedures. Twenty pediatric oncology patients 
      participated in the study. They were not informed that hypnosis was one of the 
      strategies. Subjects were screened for hypnotizability and randomly assigned to 
      treatments. Demographic data were collected. Pre-strategy training observations were 
      made during a Bone Marrow Aspiration or Lumbar Puncture (BMA/LP) using visual analog 
      scales, the McGill Pain Questionnaire, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, pulse and 
      temperature readings, and interview. Following strategy training, data were 
      collected during a second BMA/LP using the same measures as employed 
      pre-intervention. Results indicated that both strategies were effective in providing 
      pain reduction. Neither technique provided for anxiety reduction. Hypnotizability 
      scale scores failed to correlate with degree of pain reduction.

TI  - Organic solvent-induced encephalopathy in industrial painters.
PG  - 119-25
AB  - Although organic solvents are essential components of an industrial economy, they 
      are not used without risk. The relationship between excessive exposure to organic 
      solvents and subsequent development of chronic encephalopathy has been recognized 
      for nearly 100 years. Fifteen industrial painters who underwent evaluation in an 
      occupational health clinic for symptoms that they related to their work were found 
      to have a high prevalence of neurasthenic symptoms, most frequently, memory loss and 
      personality change. Although neurologic and screening laboratory examinations showed 
      no consistent abnormalities, psychological tests documented poor short-term memory 
      and an array of neuropsychologic deficits. Personality profiles revealed depression, 
      anxiety, and preoccupation with somatic concerns. These findings agree well with 
      previous reports of "chronic painter's syndrome." Heightened awareness among 
      industrial physicians and prospective studies to evaluate existing threshold limit 
      values and personal protective equipment requirements are indicated.

TI  - The prevalence of fatigue among Chinese nursing students in post-COVID-19 era.
PG  - e11154
LID - 10.7717/peerj.11154 [doi]
LID - e11154
AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, all teaching activities in nursing schools 
      were suspended in China, and many nursing students were summoned to work in 
      hospitals to compensate for the shortage of manpower. This study examined the 
      prevalence of fatigue and its association with quality of life (QOL) among nursing 
      students during the post-COVID-19 era in China. METHODS: This was a multicenter, 
      cross-sectional study. Nursing students in five Chinese universities were invited to 
      participate. Fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, pain and QOL were measured 
      using standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 nursing students 
      participated. The prevalence of fatigue was 67.3% (95% CI [64.4-70.0]). Multiple 
      logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (P = 0.003, OR = 1.73, 95% CI 
      [1.20-2.49]), and being a senior nursing student (second year: OR = 2.20, 95% CI 
      [1.46-3.33], P < 0.001; third year: OR = 3.53, 95% CI [2.31-5.41], P < 0.001; and 
      fourth year OR = 3.59, 95% CI [2.39-5.40], P < 0.001) were significantly associated 
      with more severe fatigue. In addition, moderate economic loss during the COVID-19 
      pandemic (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.08-3.33], P < 0.015; compared to low loss), 
      participants with more severe depressive (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.22-1.78], P < 0.001) 
      and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.05-1.20], P = 0.001), and more severe 
      pain (OR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.46-1.91], P < 0.001) were significantly associated with 
      reported more severe fatigue. After controlling for covariates, nursing students 
      with fatigue had a lower overall QOL score compared to those without (F ((1, 1070)) 
      = 31.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fatigue was common among nursing students in the 
      post-COVID-19 era. Considering the negative impact of fatigue on QOL and daily 
      functioning, routine physical and mental health screening should be conducted for 
      nursing students. Effective stress-reduction measures should be enforced to assist 
      this subpopulation to combat fatigue and restore optimal health.

AB  - Individuals with Spina Bifida (SB) have unique lifelong medical and social needs. 
      Thus, when considering how to promote health and offer preventive care, providers 
      must adapt general healthcare screening and counseling recommendations to their 
      patients' physical and cognitive impairments along with discerning how to monitor 
      secondary or chronic conditions common to the population. This article provides an 
      update on the health promotion and preventive health care guidelines developed as 
      part of the Spina Bifida Association's fourth edition of the Guidelines for the Care 
      of People with Spina Bifida. The guidelines highlight accommodations needed to 
      promote general preventive health, common secondary/chronic conditions such as 
      obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, musculoskeletal pain, and considerations 
      for preventing acute care utilization for the SB population throughout the lifespan. 
      Further research is needed to understand the effectiveness of preventive care 
      interventions in promoting positive health outcomes and mitigating potentially 
      preventable acute care utilization.

PG  - 2609-16
LID - 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02627.x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The Sexual Function Questionnaire (SFQ) is a self-report outcome 
      measure of female sexual function. It has recently been refined to create a 28-item 
      version (SFQ28) including the addition of a new arousal-cognitive domain. AIM: This 
      study aimed to validate the SFQ28 in female sexual arousal disorder (FSAD) and 
      hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) populations and to develop a screening 
      cut-score for the arousal-cognitive domain. METHODS: Women with FSAD (n=222) and 
      HSDD (n=114) and 303 women without female sexual dysfunction (FSD) completed the 
      SFQ28, the Female Sexual Distress Scale (FSDS), and the Sexual Quality of 
      Life-Female (SQOL-F) at a clinic visit. Retests were performed within FSD groups 
      only (FSAD: n=92, HSDD: n=183), using postal questionnaires 7-14 days later. The 
      optimal cut-score for the arousal-cognitive domain was based on diagnostic tests of 
      sensitivity and specificity from a receiver operating characteristic curve. MAIN 
      OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychometric analyses. RESULTS: The factor analysis confirmed the 
      domain structure of the SFQ28. The SFQ28 demonstrated excellent internal 
      consistency, test retest reliability and known groups validity, and good convergent 
      validity with the FSDS and SQOL-F for all domains except pain. The 
      sensitivity/specificity analysis determined a screening cut-score of 5 for the 
      arousal-cognitive domain. CONCLUSION: Given the replication of the psychometric data 
      and the cut-scores for each domain, the SFQ28 is a robust measure that can be used 
      in women with either FSAD or HSDD.

TI  - Implications of opioid analgesia for medically complicated patients.
PG  - 417-33
LID - 10.2165/11536540-000000000-00000 [doi]
AB  - Opioid analgesics have an established role in the management of postoperative pain 
      and cancer pain, and are gaining acceptance for the management of moderate to severe 
      chronic noncancer pain, most notably chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis, that 
      does not respond to other interventions. Many patients with chronic pain have 
      co-morbid medical conditions that may complicate opioid therapy. Selecting the 
      appropriate opioid requires knowledge of how individual opioids differ with respect 
      to metabolism and interaction with concurrent medications, as well as the reasons 
      why specific medical conditions may influence their efficacy and tolerability. 
      Polypharmacy is a common complicating condition in the elderly and in patients with 
      psychiatric illness, cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus or other 
      chronic illnesses. Polypharmacy, though often necessary for patients with multiple 
      medical conditions, also multiplies the risk of drug interactions. Pharmacokinetic 
      drug interactions can increase or reduce exposure to the opioid or concurrent 
      medications, reducing efficacy and/or tolerability and increasing toxicity. 
      Pharmacodynamic interactions can enhance the depressive effects of opioids, 
      compromising safety. Patients with impaired renal or hepatic function may have 
      difficulty clearing or metabolizing opioids and concurrent medications, leading to 
      increased risk of adverse events. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular or 
      respiratory disease (including smokers of >/=2 packs/day with no other diagnosis) 
      may be more susceptible to respiratory depression, bradycardia and hypotension with 
      any opioid, and a few specific opioids pose additional risks. Patients with 
      cerebrovascular disease, dementia, brain injury or psychiatric illness are more 
      susceptible to opioid effects on the CNS, which can include euphoria, cognitive 
      impairment and sedation. Appropriate opioid selection may mitigate these effects. 
      Even in older patients, addiction, abuse and misdirection of prescribed opioids are 
      of concern. Higher risk exists for patients with psychiatric illness, history of 
      substance abuse, and identifiable substance abuse risk factors. Screening for abuse 
      potential and vigilant patient monitoring should be routine. Opioids differ in their 
      ability to produce euphoria, based on opioid receptor agonism, but substance abusers 
      may be more influenced by availability, familiarity and cost factors. Consequently, 
      opioid selection has limited influence on abuse potential but can facilitate ease of 
      monitoring. This review provides an overview of opioid use in medically complicated 
      patients and recommendations on how to optimize analgesia while avoiding adverse 
      events and drug interactions in the clinical setting. Articles cited in this review 
      were identified via a search of EMBASE and PubMed. Articles selected for inclusion

TI  - Cognitive testing of PAINReportIt in adult African Americans with sickle cell 
      disease.

AB  - PAINReportIt, a computerized version of the McGill Pain Questionnaire (Pain. 1975, 
      1:277-299), presents pain measurement items to responders in serial display screens 
      accompanied by pop-up screens. In this study, we used cognitive interviews to 
      examine further validity of PAINReportIt with 25 African Americans with sickle cell 
      disease. The specific aims were to determine if the questions in the PAINReportIt 
      program were relevant to and understood by African Americans with sickle cell 
      disease and to describe the nature of the pain they experienced. Most study 
      participants were enthusiastic and able to use the tool as intended and appreciated 
      the comprehensiveness, detail, and multidimensionality of its pain data. For some 
      screens, two to six participants' responses suggested some question understanding 
      and interpretation issues, inability to retrieve the requested information, or 
      technical issues. Their responses indicated that screens lacked sufficient 
      specificity for the temporal nature of pain recurrence over a lifetime. The program 
      captured both nociceptive and neuropathic aspects of sickle cell pain and provided 
      detailed information on the location, intensity, quality, and pattern of pain 
      experienced by participants. We recommend that future revisions to the PAINReportIt 
      program address the temporal issues of measuring recurrent pain, resolve 
      technological issues related to pop-ups, and simplify difficult words to better 
      match the typical health literacy levels of patients. These revisions could further 
      enhance the technological aspects, usability, and cultural appropriateness of the 
      tool for African Americans with sickle cell disease.

      patients living with multiple myeloma and their partners.
PG  - 88-97

AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this project was to identify the nature and range of needs, as 
      well as levels of quality of life (QOL), of both patients living with myeloma and 
      their partners. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was used, recruiting patients and 
      their partners from 4 hospitals in the United Kingdom at a mean time post-diagnosis 
      of 5 years. Patients completed a scale exploring their Supportive Care Needs, the 
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and the EORTC QOL scale with its 
      Myeloma module. The partners completed the partners' version of the Supportive Care 
      Needs scale and HADS. RESULTS: A total of 132 patients and 93 of their partners 
      participated. One-quarter of the patients and one-third of the partners reported 
      unmet supportive care needs. About 27.4% of patients reported signs of anxiety and 
      25.2% reported signs of depression. Almost half the partners (48.8%) reported signs 
      of anxiety and 13.6% signs of depression. Anxious/depressed patients had more than 
      double unmet needs than non-anxious/depressed patients (P<0.05). QOL was moderate, 
      with key areas of impairment being physical, emotional, social and cognitive 
      functioning, and patients complained of several symptoms, including tiredness 
      (40.7%), pain (35.9%), insomnia (32.3%), peripheral neuropathies (28.3%) and memory 
      problems (22.3%). About 40.8% were worried about their health in the future. 
      CONCLUSION: Long-term supportive care services should provide support to both 
      patients and their partners in relation to their unmet needs, screening them for 
      psychological disorders, referring them appropriately and timely, and optimising 
      symptom management in order to improve the patients' QOL.

TI  - Evaluating cognitive, emotional, and physical fatigue domains in daily practice by 
      single-item questions in patients with advanced cancer: a cross-sectional pragmatic 
      study.
PG  - 505-14
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2008.12.009 [doi]
AB  - To assess cancer-related fatigue (CRF), multidimensional questionnaires are 
      required. The aim of this study was to evaluate single-item fatigue (SIF) screening 
      questions-one for global fatigue and three for the fatigue domains (cognitive, 
      emotional, and physical)-for their immediate use in daily oncology practice. 
      Sixty-one fatigued patients with advanced cancer completed SIF assessments (visual 
      analog scales for global fatigue and for fatigue in the cognitive, emotional, and 
      physical domains, respectively), and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Fatigue 
      Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), 
      and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 
      Quality-of-Life-C30 (QLQ-C30). SIF-global correlated with BFI (r=0.51), and the 
      domain-SIFs correlated with their respective FAQ domains (cognitive r=0.59; 
      affective r=0.45; physical r=0.33) and functional EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales (r=0.62; 
      r=0.42; r=0.34). The SIF-emotional also correlated with HADS-Anxiety (r=0.43) and 
      HADS-Depression (r=0.62). Principal component analysis (domain-SIF; respective FAQ 
      and functional EORTC QLQ-C30 subscales) revealed three clusters and a two-factor 
      model (cognitive/emotional, physical), explaining 74% of variability. Patients with 
      one predominant SIF domain had more domain-tailored fatigue interventions than had 
      patients with mixed SIFs. These data suggest that three simple SIF questions permit 
      rapid assessment of the physical and cognitive and probably the emotional domains of 
      CRF in patients with advanced cancer.

TI  - Medical marijuana: the conflict between scientific evidence and political ideology. 
      Part one of two.
PG  - 4-25
LID - 10.1080/15360280902727973 [doi]
AB  - Whether "medical marijuana" (Cannabis sativa used to treat a wide variety of 
      pathologic states) should be accorded the status of a legitimate pharmaceutical 
      agent has long been a contentious issue. Is it a truly effective drug that is 
      arbitrarily stigmatized by many and criminalized by the federal government? Or is it 
      without any medical utility, its advocates hiding behind a screen of misplaced (or 
      deliberately misleading) compassion for the ill? Should Congress repeal its 
      declaration that smoked marijuana is without "current medical benefit"? Should 
      cannabis be approved for medical use by a vote of the people as already has been 
      done in 13 states? Or should medical marijuana be scientifically evaluated for 
      safety and efficacy as any other new investigational drug? How do the competing--and 
      sometimes antagonistic--roles of science, politics and prejudice affect society's 
      attempts to answer this question? This article examines the legal, political, 
      policy, and ethical problems raised by the recognition of medical marijuana by over 
      one-fourth of our states although its use remains illegal under federal law. 
      Although draconian punishment can be imposed for the "recreational" use of 
      marijuana, I will not address the contentious question of whether to legalize or 
      decriminalize the use of marijuana solely for its psychotropic effects, a 
      fascinating and important area of law and policy that is outside the scope of this 
      paper. Instead, the specific focus of this article will be on the conflict between 
      the development of policies based on evidence obtained through the use of scientific 
      methods and those grounded on ideological and political considerations that have 
      repeatedly entered the longstanding debate regarding the legal status of medical 
      marijuana. I will address a basic question: Should the approval of medical marijuana 
      be governed by the same statute that applies to all other drugs or pharmaceutical 
      agents, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), after the appropriate 
      regulatory agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has evaluated its safety 
      and efficacy? If not, should medical marijuana be exempted from scientific review 
      and, instead, be evaluated by the Congress, state legislatures, or popular vote? I 
      will argue that advocacy is a poor substitute for dispassionate analysis, and that 
      popular votes should not be allowed to trump scientific evidence in deciding whether 
      or not marijuana is an appropriate pharmaceutical agent to use in modern medical 
      practice.

TI  - VIRTUAL REALITY HYPNOSIS.
PG  - 40-47
AB  - Scientific evidence for the viability of hypnosis as a treatment for pain has 
      flourished over the past two decades (Rainville, Duncan, Price, Carrier and 
      Bushnell, 1997; Montgomery, DuHamel and Redd, 2000; Lang and Rosen, 2002; Patterson 
      and Jensen, 2003). However its widespread use has been limited by factors such as 
      the advanced expertise, time and effort required by clinicians to provide hypnosis, 
      and the cognitive effort required by patients to engage in hypnosis.The theory in 
      developing virtual reality hypnosis was to apply three-dimensional, immersive, 
      virtual reality technology to guide the patient through the same steps used when 
      hypnosis is induced through an interpersonal process. Virtual reality replaces many 
      of the stimuli that the patients have to struggle to imagine via verbal cueing from 
      the therapist. The purpose of this paper is to explore how virtual reality may be 
      useful in delivering hypnosis, and to summarize the scientific literature to date. 
      We will also explore various theoretical and methodological issues that can guide 
      future research.In spite of the encouraging scientific and clinical findings, 
      hypnosis for analgesia is not universally used in medical centres. One reason for 
      the slow acceptance is the extensive provider training required in order for 
      hypnosis to be an effective pain management modality. Training in hypnosis is not 
      commonly offered in medical schools or even psychology graduate curricula. Another 
      reason is that hypnosis requires far more time and effort to administer than an 
      analgesic pill or injection. Hypnosis requires training, skill and patience to 
      deliver in medical centres that are often fast-paced and highly demanding of 
      clinician time. Finally, the attention and cognitive effort required for hypnosis 
      may be more than patients in an acute care setting, who may be under the influence 
      of opiates and benzodiazepines, are able to impart. It is a challenge to make 
      hypnosis a standard part of care in this environment.Over the past 25 years, 
      researchers have been investigating ways to make hypnosis more standardized and 
      accessible. There have been a handful of studies that have looked at the efficacy of 
      using audiotapes to provide the hypnotic intervention (Johnson and Wiese, 1979; 
      Hart, 1980; Block, Ghoneim, Sum Ping and Ali, 1991; Enqvist, Bjorklund, Engman and 
      Jakobsson, 1997; Eberhart, Doring, Holzrichter, Roscher and Seeling, 1998; Perugini, 
      Kirsch, Allen, et al., 1998; Forbes, MacAuley, Chiotakakou-Faliakou, 2000; Ghoneim, 
      Block, Sarasin, Davis and Marchman, 2000). These studies have yielded mixed results. 
      Generally, we can conclude that audio-taped hypnosis is more effective than no 
      treatment at all, but less effective than the presence of a live hypnotherapist. 
      Grant and Nash (1995) were the first to use computer-assisted hypnosis as a 
      behavioural measure to assess hypnotizability. They used a digitized voice that 
      guided subjects through a procedure and tailored software according to the subject's 
      unique responses and reactions. However, it utilized conventional two-dimensional 
      screen technology that required patients to focus their attention on a computer 
      screen, making them vulnerable to any type of distraction that might enter the 
      environment. Further, the two-dimensional technology did not present compelling 
      visual stimuli for capturing the user's attention.

TI  - Predictor Variables for a Positive Long-Term Functional Outcome in Patients with 
      Acute and Chronic Neck and Back Pain Treated with a McKenzie Approach: A Secondary 
      Analysis.
PG  - 155-60
AB  - A cognitive behavioral approach was previously compared to a biomechanical approach 
      (the McKenzie method) for the treatment of patients with back and neck pain in a 
      randomized trial. Few differences between the treatment interventions were found. 
      The aim of this secondary analysis was to determine if any clinical characteristics 
      distinguished those patients who responded best to the McKenzie approach. Treatment 
      success was defined as 50% reduction in original functional disability scores 
      (Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire or Northwick Park Neck Pain Questionnaire); 
      failure to achieve this was defined as treatment failure. A liberal definition of 
      success was 50% improvement retained at either 6 or 12 months, whereas a strict 
      definition of success was 50% improvement at both 6 and 12 months. Ten variables 
      were screened by univariate regression analysis to see if they predicted success. 
      Any significant variables (P < 0.1) underwent multiple regression analysis. Only 21 
      and 16 patients out of 102 were deemed treatment successes according to the liberal 
      and strict definitions, respectively. With the liberal definition, only 
      centralization (P = 0.065), spine region (back rather than neck pain) (P = 0.089), 
      and duration of pain (P = 0.001) emerged as predictors from the univariate 
      regression analysis. With the strict definition, only the latter two variables 
      emerged: spine region (P = 0.026) and duration of pain (P <0.01). All these 
      variables were retained in the multiple regression analysis. In this study, duration 
      of pain was the strongest predictor of success, although back pain and 
      centralization had some predictive ability.

TI  - The impact of viewing a hysteroscopy on a screen on the patient's experience: a 
      randomised trial.
PG  - 286-92; discussion 292-3
LID - 10.1111/j.1471-0528.2008.02035.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The introduction of patient screens for outpatient procedures is 
      becoming increasingly common. To date, the impact on the patient of viewing the 
      screen remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To explore how viewing the screen during a 
      hysteroscopy procedure affects the patient's experience. SETTING: The outpatient 
      clinics at the Royal Surrey Hospital in Guildford and the Royal Infirmary in 
      Bradford. DESIGN: A randomised control trial. SAMPLE: Women undergoing a 
      hysteroscopy procedure were randomly allocated to see the screen (n=81) or not to 
      see the screen (n=76). METHODS: A quantitative study with measures taken before and 
      after the intervention. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pain perception, mood, illness 
      cognitions, communication. RESULTS: Seeing the screen or not had no impact on 
      several measures of pain perception, mood, illness cognitions or communication. 
      However, women who did not see the screen were more optimistic about the 
      effectiveness of their treatment and felt that the health professional was more 
      receptive to them during the consultation compared with those who saw the screen. 
      After controlling for the use of a local anaesthetic, those who did not see the 
      screen also reported a greater decrease in anxiety after the procedure. However, 
      those who saw the screen described pain more positively (i.e. in terms of comfort, 
      reassurance or encouragement) compared with those who did not see the screen. 
      CONCLUSION: Viewing the screen does not benefit the patient and may interfere with 
      the patient-physician interaction.

TI  - Comparing the use of the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire and Beck Depression 
      Inventory for screening depression in patients with chronic pain.
PG  - 369-77
AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that the validity of self-reported depression 
      questionnaires may be influenced by somatic symptoms such as chronic pain. The 
      purpose of this study was to compare the validity of two self-reported 
      questionnaires, the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ) and the Beck Depression 
      Inventory (BDI), for screening depression in patients with chronic pain. METHODS: 
      One hundred patients with chronic pain were enrolled and assessed using the TDQ, 
      BDI, McGill Pain Questionnaire, and Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III-R. 
      Seventy-three of them were diagnosed with depressive disorders. Conventional 
      validity indices of the TDQ and BDI were examined and compared. RESULTS: Both the 
      TDQ and BDI had satisfactory sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, 
      and negative predictive value. Our results showed a trend that the validity of the 
      TDQ was better than that of the BDI, and the validity of the cognitive/affective 
      components of the TDQ was significantly better than that of the BDI. CONCLUSION: Our 
      results suggest that the TDQ is superior to the BDI in detecting depression in 
      patients with chronic pain in Taiwan.

TI  - A review of assessment tools of illness representations: are these adapted for a 
      work disability prevention context?
PG  - 347-61
LID - 10.1007/s10926-008-9148-x [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Musculoskeletal disorders are among the main causes of short- and 
      long-term disability. AIM: Identify the methods for assessing multidimensional 
      components of illness representations. METHODS: An electronic literature search 
      (French, English) from 1980 to the present was conducted in medical, paramedical and 
      social science databases using predetermined key words. After screening titles and 
      abstracts based on a specific set of criteria, sixty-four articles were reviewed. 
      RESULTS: Qualitative approaches for assessing illness representation were found 
      mainly in the fields of anthropology and sociology and were based on the explanatory 
      models of illness. The interviews reviewed were: the Short Explanatory Model 
      Interview, the Explanatory Model of Illness Catalogue and the McGill Illness 
      Narrative Interview. Quantitative approaches were found in the health psychology 
      field and used the following self-administered questionnaires: the Survey of Pain 
      Attitudes, the Pain Beliefs and Perceptions Inventory, the Pain Beliefs 
      Questionnaire, the Fear-Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, the Implicit Model of 
      Illness Questionnaire, the Illness Perception Questionnaire, including its 
      derivatives, and the Illness Cognition Questionnaire. CONCLUSION: This review shows 
      the actual use and existence of multiple interviews and questionnaires in assessing 
      multidimensional illness representations. All have been used and/or tested in a 
      medical context but none have been tested in a work disability context. Further 
      research will be needed to determine their suitability for use in a work disability 
      context.

TI  - Demographic, clinical, and pain characteristics are associated with average pain 
      severity groups in a sample of oncology outpatients.
PG  - 873-82
LID - 10.1016/j.jpain.2008.05.001 [doi]
AB  - Cut-points (CP) for pain severity are useful because they may help clinicians to 
      identify patients with clinically significant pain. However, a need exists to 
      evaluate whether different pain severity groups differ on selected demographic, 
      clinical, and pain characteristics, as well as on factors that may be amenable to 
      psychoeducational interventions such as self-efficacy for pain management, coping 
      strategies, and barriers to pain management. In this cross-sectional study of 210 
      oncology outpatients with pain, an optimal CP of 4 was found using ratings of 
      average pain intensity. The variables that provided a unique contribution to the 
      prediction of membership in the >4 CP group were gender, presence of breakthrough 
      pain, comorbidities, barriers to pain management, and total self-efficacy for pain 
      management. In addition, patients in the >4 CP group reported lower scores on 
      physical, role, cognitive, and global health function. PERSPECTIVE: An average pain 
      CP of >4 could be used to screen oncology outpatients with clinically significant 
      pain. Clinicians must consider a number of demographic, clinical, and pain 
      characteristics as part of their pain assessment procedures. The effectiveness of 
      psychoeducational interventions aimed at barriers and patients self-efficacy for 
      pain management need to be tested.

TI  - Assessment of pain.
PG  - 17-24
LID - 10.1093/bja/aen103 [doi]
AB  - Valid and reliable assessment of pain is essential for both clinical trials and 
      effective pain management. The nature of pain makes objective measurement 
      impossible. Acute pain can be reliably assessed, both at rest (important for 
      comfort) and during movement (important for function and risk of postoperative 
      complications), with one-dimensional tools such as numeric rating scales or visual 
      analogue scales. Both these are more powerful in detecting changes in pain intensity 
      than a verbal categorical rating scale. In acute pain trials, assessment of baseline 
      pain must ensure sufficient pain intensity for the trial to detect meaningful 
      treatment effects. Chronic pain assessment and its impact on physical, emotional, 
      and social functions require multidimensional qualitative tools and health-related 
      quality of life instruments. Several disease- and patient-specific functional scales 
      are useful, such as the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities for 
      osteoarthritis, and several neuropathic pain screening tools. The Initiative on 
      METHODS: Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials recommendations for 
      outcome measurements of chronic pain trials are also useful for routine assessment. 
      Cancer pain assessment is complicated by a number of other bodily and mental 
      symptoms such as fatigue and depression, all affecting quality of life. It is 
      noteworthy that quality of life reported by chronic pain patients can be as much 
      affected as that of terminal cancer patients. Any assessment of pain must take into 
      account other factors, such as cognitive impairment or dementia, and assessment 
      tools validated in the specific patient groups being studied.

PG  - 14-20
LID - 10.1111/j.1468-1331.2008.02056.x [doi]
AB  - Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      is associated with a broad spectrum of non-motor symptoms. These include disorders 
      of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and 
      hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with 
      hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep-wake cycle 
      regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital 
      dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of 
      patients. Whilst overall non-motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with 
      advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor 
      signs - most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour 
      disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these 
      non-motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD 
      or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear 
      consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and 
      colleagues. Screening these early non-motor features might, therefore, be one 
      approach towards early 'preclinical' diagnosis of PD. This review article provides 
      an overview of the clinical spectrum of non-motor symptoms in PD together with a 
      brief review of treatment options.

TI  - Cognitive and dissociative manifestations in fibromyalgia.
PG  - 77-84
AB  - Memory decline and mental confusion frequently complicate the clinical presentation 
      of fibromyalgia; however, formal cognitive examination often does not support 
      deterioration. This paradox was examined in the context of dissociation, a condition 
      with many cognitive similarities. Dissociation refers to the separation of parts of 
      experience from the mainstream of consciousness. A common example is highway 
      hypnosis. Eighty-nine fibromyalgia (FM) patients and 64 other rheumatic disease 
      patients were screened for memory decline and mental confusion using a questionnaire 
      format. Pain, dissociation, affective distress, fatigue, sleep difficulty, and 
      mental confusion were also assessed. Cognitive complaints (76.4%-43.8%) and 
      dissociative symptoms (37.1%-1.9%) were overrepresented in patients with FM. Among 
      FM patients with high dissociation, cognitive difficulties were reported by 95%; 
      100% of these cases reported that both memory and mental clarity were affected, a 
      condition referred to as fibrofog. Dissociation in combination with fibrofog was 
      associated with higher levels of FM symptom intensity and decreased mental well 
      being. These findings suggest that dissociation may play a role in FM symptom 
      amplification and may aid in comprehending the regularity of cognitive symptoms. 
      Separating cases of fibrofog from cognitive conditions with actual brain damage is 
      important. It may be prudent to add a test of dissociation as an adjunct to the 
      evaluation of FM patients in cases of suspected fibrofog. Otherwise, test results 
      may prove normal even in patients with disabling cognitive symptoms.

TI  - Aortic arch atheroma: stroke reduction in cardiac surgical patients.
PG  - 143-57
AB  - Cardiac surgery is increasingly performed on elderly patients with extensive 
      coronary artery abnormalities who have impaired left ventricular function, decreased 
      physiologic reserve, and multiple comorbid conditions. Considerable numbers of these 
      patients develop perioperative neurologic complications ranging from subtle 
      cognitive dysfunction to more evident postoperative confusion, delirium, and, less 
      commonly, clinically apparent stroke. Magnetic resonance imaging studies have 
      elucidated that a considerable number of patients have new ischemic brain infarcts, 
      particularly after conventional coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Mechanisms of 
      cerebral injury during and after cardiac surgery are discussed. Intraoperative 
      transesophageal echocardiography and epiaortic scanning for detection of 
      atheromatous disease of the proximal thoracic aorta is paramount in identifying 
      patients at high risk from neurologic injury. It is important to recognize that our 
      efforts to minimize neurologic injury should not be limited to the intraoperative 
      period. Particular efforts should be directed to temperature management, glycemia 
      control, and pharmacologic neuroprotection extending into the postoperative period. 
      Preoperative magnetic resonance angiography may be of value for screening patients 
      with significant atheroma of the proximal thoracic aorta. It is likely that for 
      patients with no significant atheromatous disease, conventional coronary artery 
      revascularization is the most effective long-term strategy, whereas patients with 
      atheromatous thoracic aorta may be better managed with beating heart surgery, hybrid 
      techniques, or medical therapy alone. Patient stratification based on the aortic 
      atheromatic burden should be addressed in future trials designed to tailor treatment 
      strategies to improve long-term outcomes of coronary heart disease and reduce the 
      risks of perioperative neurologic injury.

TI  - Difficulty in the diagnosis of Cushing disease.
PG  - 53-7; quiz following 57
AB  - BACKGROUND: A 48-year-old woman presented to our clinic 1 year after hypertension 
      was discovered on a routine screening visit. During the previous year, she had 
      noticed weight gain in the face and abdomen, easy bruising, oligomenorrhea and 
      facial and periareolar hair growth. On presentation, she reported no weakness, 
      fracture, back pain, depression, irritability, problem with cognition or memory, 
      increased appetite, hot flashes or altered sleep. Previous medication history 
      included 2.5 mg lisinopril daily and 25.0 mg hydrochlorothiazide daily for 12 
      months. INVESTIGATIONS: Measurement of urine glucocorticoid excretion, evening 
      plasma and salivary cortisol levels, and basal and 
      corticotropin-releasing-hormone-stimulated adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol 
      levels. An overnight 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test, pituitary MRI, 
      inferior-petrosal-sinus sampling, cavernous sinus and jugular venous sampling were 
      performed. DIAGNOSIS: Cushing disease. MANAGEMENT: The patient underwent 
      trans-sphenoidal resection, assessment of remission and subsequent treatment with 
      hydrocortisone.

TI  - A rapid screening tool for fatigue impact in multiple sclerosis.
PG  - 27
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common complaint in multiple sclerosis (MS) and often 
      interferes with daily functioning. Both clinicians and researchers may need to 
      detect high levels of fatigue impact using a time and effort efficient tool. This 
      study evaluates the psychometric properties of a rapid screening instrument for 
      fatigue impact in multiple sclerosis. METHODS: Three visual analogue scales (VAS) 
      for assessing the impact of fatigue were developed. Sixty two subjects with definite 
      MS (mean age 52 +/- 10.5 years; 29 women) and 24 healthy controls (mean age 52 +/- 
      14 years; 13 women) completed all VAS scales (range 0-100), the Fatigue Severity 
      Scale (FSS) (range 7-63), the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS) (range 0-84) and 
      the Guy's Neurological Disability Scale (GNDS) (range 0-5). All tests were repeated 
      with an interval of maximum three days. To evaluate the reproducibility, intraclass 
      correlations (ICC) were calculated, based on one-way analysis of variance for 
      repeated measurements. Validity was considered by means of correlation coefficients. 
      ROC analysis was used to determine the accuracy of the VAS scales. RESULTS: The ICC 
      of the VAS scales ranged from 0.68 to 0.69. VAS scales showed low to moderate 
      correlation with FSS, MFIS and GNDS (Kendall's tau 0.23-0.45) and were not related 
      with physical or cognitive performance, or with depression. All VAS scales were able 
      to discriminate between subjects with MS and controls. Twenty five subjects with MS 
      had a Fatigue Severity Scale score of 36 or more and were classified into the 
      "fatigue" group. ROC analysis showed that VAS_1 is most useful to classify subjects 
      in the "fatigue" group. A cut-off value of VAS_1 of 59 displayed 76% sensitivity and 
      72% specificity. When using the MFIS score of 40 or more to classify the groups, 
      VAS_1 remained the strongest tool, with 81% sensitivity and 77% specificity at a 
      cut-off value of 59. CONCLUSION: The VAS for the impact of fatigue on daily life 
      (VAS_1) is a moderately reliable, though valid and useful tool to screen rapidly for 
      fatigue impact in multiple sclerosis. A cut-off value of 59 satisfactorily 
      classifies individuals having severe fatigue with a high impact on daily life. In 
      clinical practice, a more comprehensive assessment of fatigue and the impact on 
      daily life is recommended.

TI  - Health complaints in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
PG  - 664-70
AB  - AIM: To assess recurrent subjective health complaints in Swedish schoolchildren with 
      attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). METHODS: Cohort study of 577 
      fourth-graders (10-y-olds) in one municipality in Stockholm County. All children 
      were screened for attention and behaviour problems through interviews with their 
      parents and teachers. Children with high scores underwent further clinical and 
      cognitive assessments. Information about health complaints was collected from the 
      children themselves in a classroom questionnaire. The 516 children for whom there 
      was information from all three data sources were included in the final study 
      population. Hypotheses were tested in multivariate analyses with adjustment for sex 
      and parental education. RESULTS: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), sleeping problems 
      and tiredness were associated with ADHD (stratified relative risks: 2.2 [1.4-3.4], 
      1.7 [1.1-2.7] and 2.7 [1.7-4.1], respectively), while there was no association with 
      headache. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that treatment strategies for children 
      with ADHD need to include an effective evaluation and treatment of RAP, tiredness 
      and sleeping disturbances. Evaluation of ADHD should be considered in children with 
      recurrent health complaints.

TI  - [Chronic widespread pain and tender points in low back pain: a population-based 
      study].
PG  - 76-83
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical observation suggests a frequent coincidence of back pain (BP) 
      and fibromyalgia (FMA). Based on data from a population survey on back pain we 
      studied the hypothesis of FMA being a frequent underlying condition of BP. We 
      additionally studied the association of the severity of back pain and both chronic 
      widespread musculoskeletal pain and active tender points. PROBANDS AND METHODS: Data 
      from a regional two-stage survey on urban German residents (aged 25-74 years) of 
      Luebeck/Northern Germany (N=3969) were reanalyzed. The survey combined a postal 
      questionnaire screening with a subsequent medical-psychological examination. Only 
      subjects with back pain on the day of filling in the questionnaire were invited (n = 
      875). The response and participation rates were 82% and 73%, respectively. The 
      severity of back pain was graded according to Kohlmann and Raspe (1994; based on 
      pain severity and disability). In assessing widespread pain and tender points and 
      classifying FMA-cases, we followed the criteria of the American College of 
      Rheumatology (Wolfe et al. 1990). Standardized psychometric scales were used to 
      measure general health status, bodily complaints, depressiveness, and 
      catastrophizing cognitions. RESULTS: In Luebeck, the overall point prevalence of 
      back pain reached 39%. Among those invited and examined we found 27%, 25%, and 19% 
      with back pain grade 1, 2 or 3, respectively. 29% reported no back pain on the day 
      of examination. 12.6% of probands with actual back pain reported chronic widespread 
      pain. The number of active tender points showed a significant and relevant 
      association with back pain grade and was additionally correlated with all indicators 
      of somatic and psychological distress. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support the 
      hypothesis of FMA as a frequent underlying condition of BP. We found, however, a 
      close correlation between BP grade (and amount of distress) and tender points count. 
      More severe forms of BP imply an increasing allodynia/hyperalgesia, itself being 
      associated with a higher amount of somatic and psychological distress (Chronic 
      severe) back pain seems to be more than simply pain in the back.

TI  - [Fear avoidance beliefs in patients with back pain. Psychometric properties of the 
      German version of the FABQ].
PG  - 17-27
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the quality criteria of a screening procedure 
      used to identify fear-avoidance beliefs. METHODS: The translated version of the 
      original FABQ was submitted to 302 patients with chronic back pain. Additionally, 
      self-assessment protocols were used to document information on disease history, 
      pain-specific parameters, extent of subjectively experienced impairment, and 
      depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Correlation statistical analysis confirmed the 
      relevance of fear-avoidance beliefs for the impairment as experienced by the 
      patients with back pain. The FABQ proved to be a better predictor of subjectively 
      experienced impairment than pain intensity or affective/emotional orientation. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Fear-avoidance beliefs represent significant cognitive factors for 
      chronification of back pain. The results demonstrated the practicability, 
      reliability, and validity of the questionnaire to assess fear-avoidance beliefs.

TI  - Assessing the independent contribution to quality of life from anxiety and 
      depression in patients with advanced cancer.
PG  - 509-13
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of palliative care services is to ensure the best quality of 
      life for patients and their carers. Depression is common amongst palliative care 
      patients and has been shown to adversely affect quality of life. This study aimed to 
      examine the independent contribution of depression to quality of life. OBJECTIVE: To 
      investigate the hypothesis that a) illness severity, pain, anxiety and depression 
      are all associated with impaired health-related quality of life and b) once the 
      effects of illness severity have been adjusted for, there is further independent 
      contribution to quality of life from anxiety and depression. METHOD: Consecutive 
      patients with advanced cancer under the care of palliative care services were 
      screened. Sixty-eight patients were evaluated for levels of anxiety and depression, 
      severity of illness, pain severity and health-related quality of life. RESULTS: 
      Thirty-three males and 35 females were recruited and had an age range of 41-93 years 
      (median 71). Seventeen (25%) of patients were anxious [anxiety score > or = 11 on 
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)], 15 (22%) were depressed (HADS 
      depression score > or = 11). After controlling for the effects of pain and illness 
      severity, anxiety and depression were independently associated with global health 
      status, emotional and cognitive functioning, and fatigue. Anxiety further 
      contributed significantly towards social functioning, nausea and vomiting. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study has confirmed that pain, anxiety and depression were 
      associated with impaired quality of life. Anxiety and depression contributed 
      independently towards various dimensions of quality of life. Longitudinal studies 
      are required to examine the direction of the causal association between pain and 
      depression in patients receiving palliative care.

TI  - [MIDOS--an electronic database for the palliative care unit].
PG  - 257-63
AB  - INTRODUCTION: A minimal documentation system (MIDOS) has been developed for 
      self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units. 
      To decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the 
      system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and 
      documentation. SYSTEM: The database is based on Microsoft Access. Screen masks are 
      used for navigation and data entry. According to the type of data items may be 
      chosen in checklists or pull-down menus or entered as free text. The main menu 
      documents personal data from the patient. Submenus can be reached from the main 
      screen mask. Submenus included are the core documentation of the working group of 
      the German Ministry of Health, the German versions of the Brief Pain Inventory, the 
      quality of life questionnaire SF-12 and the Mini Mental State Examination for 
      assessment of cognitive impairment. Data from these instruments may be assessed 
      repeatedly for the same patient. Documentation of follow-up consultations include 
      self-assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patient (MIDOS) and the analgesic 
      regimen. These informations should be documented for each consultation. CONCLUSION: 
      This data base was used in two trials on the palliative care unit of the university 
      of Cologne, confirming data safety and convenience of the programme. We recommend 
      the use of this data base in combination with MIDOS and the core documentation for 
      routine assessment on the palliative care ward.

TI  - Fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing: occurrence and risk factor in back pain 
      and ADL in the general population.
PG  - 485-491
LID - 10.1016/S0304-3959(02)00265-8 [doi]
AB  - Fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing have been shown to be powerful cognitions 
      in the process of developing chronic pain problems and there is a need for increased 
      knowledge in early stages of pain. The objectives of this study were therefore, 
      firstly, to examine the occurrence of fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing in 
      groups with different degrees of non-chronic spinal pain in a general population, 
      and secondly to assess if fear-avoidance beliefs and catastrophizing were related to 
      current ratings of pain and activities of daily living (ADL). The study was a part 
      of a population based back pain project and the study sample consisted of 917 men 
      and women, 35-45 years old, either pain-free or with non-chronic spinal pain. The 
      results showed that fear-avoidance beliefs as well as catastrophizing occur in this 
      general population of non-patients. The levels were moderate and in catastrophizing 
      a 'dose-response' pattern was seen, such that more the catastrophizing was, the more 
      was pain. The study showed two relationships, which were between fear-avoidance and 
      ADL as well as between catastrophizing and pain intensity. Logistic regression 
      analyses were performed with 95% confidence intervals and the odds ratio for 
      fear-avoidance beliefs and ADL was 2.5 and for catastrophizing and pain 1.8, both 
      with confidence interval above unity. The results suggest that fear-avoidance 
      beliefs and catastrophizing may play an active part in the transition from acute to 
      chronic pain and clinical implications include screening and early intervention.

TI  - Comparative study of electronic vs. paper VAS ratings: a randomized, crossover trial 
      using healthy volunteers.
PG  - 341-7
AB  - The visual analogue scale (VAS) is an established, validated, self-report measure 
      usually consisting of a 10 cm line on paper with verbal anchors labeling the ends. 
      Palmtop computers (PTCs also known as personal digital appliances) have incorporated 
      VAS entry by use of a touch screen. However, the validity and psychophysical 
      properties of the electronic VAS have never been formally compared with the 
      conventional paper VAS. The aim of this study is to determine the agreement between 
      the electronic (eVAS) and paper (pVAS) modes. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were 
      recruited for this study. Each study participant provided input using both 
      measurement methods by marking the eVAS and pVAS in response to two kinds of 
      stimuli, cognitive and sensory. A verbal rating scale of seven descriptors of 
      intensity represented the cognitive stimuli. Participants were asked to mark the 
      location that best corresponded to the pain intensity described by each word on 
      scales from 'no pain' to 'worst possible pain'. The sensory stimuli used were a set 
      of test weights consisting of plastic containers ranging from 7 to 129 g. The VAS 
      for sensory stimuli ranged from 0 (no weight) to 'reference weight' (the heaviest 
      weight outside the range of test weights). There were two types of input stimuli and 
      two modes for recording responses for a total of four experimental conditions. Two 
      evaluators independently measured and recorded all the pVAS forms to the nearest 
      millimeter. A total of 2016 stimuli were rated. The overall correlation for ratings 
      of both sensory and cognitive stimuli on eVAS and pVAS was r = 0.91. For paired 
      verbal stimuli the correlation was r = 0.97. For paired sensory stimuli the 
      correlation was r = 0.86. The correlation between group eVAS and pVAS ratings to 
      common verbal stimuli was r = 0.99. For common sensory stimuli the group correlation 
      was r = 0.99. The median of correlations comparing eVAS and pVAS ratings was 0.99 
      for verbal stimuli and 0.98 for sensory stimuli. Multivariate analyses showed 
      equivalent stimuli to be rated much the same whether entered on paper VAS or PTC 
      touch screen VAS (P < 0.0001). Support was found for the validity of the computer 
      version of the VAS scale.

TI  - New perspectives in CNS safety pharmacology.
PG  - 197-207
AB  - International requirements for central nervous system (CNS) safety pharmacology are 
      reviewed. Procedures for initial CNS safety screening (core battery studies) can be 
      conducted from the beginning of the drug discovery process, but at latest before 
      first studies in man. They should include assessment of general behaviour, locomotor 
      activity and motor coordination, but can also include studies of pain sensitivity, 
      convulsive threshold and interaction with hypnotics. Follow-up studies, to be 
      conducted later in the drug development process but before product approval, cover 
      assessment of higher cognitive function, electroencephalogram (EEG) and drug 
      dependence/abuse liability. Procedures for assessing cognitive function can include, 
      in order of complexity, passive avoidance, Morris and radial mazes and operant 
      behaviour tasks (delayed alternation, repeated acquisition). EEG can include the 
      quantified EEG (QEEG) and studies of the sleep/wakefulness cycle. Drug 
      dependence/abuse procedures can include precipitated and nonprecipitated withdrawal 
      (drug dependence), and place preference, drug discrimination and self-administration 
      (drug abuse). In contrast to core battery CNS procedures, conducted exclusively in 
      rodents, follow-up studies can include higher species, in particular primates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of syndromes characterised by persistent and 
      disabling mental and/or physical fatigue is of renewed interest in psychiatric 
      epidemiology. This report details the development of two specific instruments: the 
      SOFA/CFS for identification of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) in 
      specialist clinics and the SOFA/GP for identification of prolonged fatigue syndromes 
      (PFS) in community and primary care settings. METHODS: Patients with clinical 
      diagnoses of CFS (n = 770) and consecutive attenders at primary care (n = 1593) 
      completed various self-report questionnaires to assess severity of current 
      fatigue-related symptoms and other common somatic and psychological symptoms. 
      Quality receiver operating characteristic curves were used to derive appropriate 
      cut-off scores for each of the instruments. Comparisons with other self-report 
      measures of anxiety, depression and somatic distress are noted. Various multivariate 
      statistical modelling techniques [latent class analysis (LCA), longitudinal LCA] 
      were utilised to define the key features of PFS and describe its longitudinal 
      characteristics. RESULTS: The SOFA/CFS instrument performs well in specialist 
      samples likely to contain a high proportion of patients with CFS disorders. Cut-off 
      scores of either 1/2 or 2/3 can be used, depending on whether the investigators wish 
      to preferentially emphasise false-negatives or false-positives. Patients from these 
      settings can be thought of as consisting not only of those with a large number of 
      unexplained medical symptoms, but also those with rather specific musculoskeletal 
      and pain syndromes. The SOFA/GP instrument has potential cut-off scores of 1/2 or 
      2/3, with the latter preferred as it actively excludes all non-PFS cases 
      (sensitivity = 81%, specificity = 100%). Patients with these syndromes in the 
      community represent broader sets of underlying classes, with the emergence of not 
      only musculoskeletal and multisymptomatic disorders, but also persons characterised 
      by significant cognitive subjective impairment. Twelve-month longitudinal analyses 
      of the primary care sample indicated that the underlying class structure was 
      preserved over time. Comparisons with other measures of psychopathology indicated 
      the relative independence of these constructs from conventional notions of anxiety 
      and depression. CONCLUSIONS: The SOFA/GP instrument (which is considerably modified 
      from the SOFA/CFS in terms of anchor points for severity and chronicity) is 
      preferred for screening in primary care and community settings. Patients with PFS 
      and CFS present a range of psychopathology that differs in its underlying structure, 
      cross-sectionally and longitudinally, from coventional notions of anxiety and 
      depression.

TI  - The application of the principles of geriatrics to the management of the older 
      person with cancer.
PG  - 147-54
AB  - Is the patient going to die of cancer or with cancer? Is the patient going to suffer 
      pain and disability due to cancer? Is the patient able to tolerate aggressive 
      life-prolonging treatment? This paper tries to reply to the fundamentals of these 
      questions by introducing the multidimensional assessment that evaluates areas where 
      age-related changes are more likely. Chronologic age cannot be used to predict the 
      degree of comorbidity and of functional deterioration of the single individual up to 
      age 85 at least. Assessment of aging includes health, functional status, nutrition, 
      cognition, socio-economic and emotion evaluations. This multidisciplinary assessment 
      is referred to as comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). The risk of comorbid 
      conditions increases with age and may result in underdiagnosis: in older patients, 
      new symptoms may not be clearly recognized by the patient and may be dismissed by 
      practitioners as manifestations of preexisting conditions. A meaningful assessment 
      of comorbidity may be obtained with a comorbidity index. The Charlson scale and the 
      Chronic Illness Rating Scale - Geriatric (CIRS-G), have enjoyed the widest 
      acceptance. The Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) and the Activities of 
      Daily Living (ADL) are the most sensitive assessment of function in older 
      individuals. IADLs include shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, laundry, meal 
      preparation, ability to use transportation and telephone and ability to take 
      medications: in simple words, the IADLs are those skills a person needs to live 
      independently. ADLs include feeding, grooming, transferring, toileting and are the 
      skills necessary for basic living. Though a correlation exists among comorbidity, 
      performance status, ADL and IADL, this correlation is not strong enough to be 
      reflected in a single parameter. The Folstein Mini Mental Status (MMS), is the 
      instrument of most frequent use to screen older individuals for dementia. The main 
      problem with the MMS is lack of sensitivity to early stages of dementia. The 
      Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), a simple tool that can be completed by most 
      patients at home, doubles the rate of detection of depression. The Mini Nutritional 
      assessment is very sensitive to screen older persons for malnutrition. The risk of 
      polypharmacy increases with age and partly results from the fact that older patients 
      visit different practitioners. A CGA should also include evaluation of the so called 
      Geriatric Syndromes like delirium, incontinence, osteoporosis, all of which 
      represent a hallmark of frailty. The CGA may help the management of older 
      individuals with cancer in at least three areas: detection of frailty, treatment of 
      unsuspected conditions, removal of social barrier to treatment.

TI  - Limitations of the SF-36 in a sample of nursing home residents.
PG  - 562-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: to assess test characteristics of the Medical Outcomes Study SF-36 
      (Short-Form 36) with residents of nursing homes. RESEARCH DESIGN: nursing home 
      residents with 17 or more points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and > 
      or = 3 months residence (128 of 552 screened) were selected randomly. Interviewers 
      administered the SF-36 (repeated after 1 week), Geriatric Depression Scale and MMSE. 
      We recorded activities of daily living and medication data from medical records. 
      Data analysis included test-retest intraclass correlations, item completion, score 
      distributions and SF-36 correlations with measures of physical and mental 
      functioning. RESULTS: 97 nursing home residents (75.8%) consented. Test-retest 
      intraclass correlation coefficients were good to excellent (range = 0.55 to 0.82). 
      Convergent validity between SF-36 physical health scales and the activities of daily 
      living index was modest (r range = -0.37 to -0.43). About 25% of residents scored 
      zero (lowest score) on at least one SF-36 physical function measure. SF-36 mental 
      health scales correlated strongly with the Geriatric Depression Scale (r range = 
      -0.63 to -0.71) and modestly with bodily pain (r = -0.35). No SF-36 scales 
      correlated strongly with the MMSE. CONCLUSION: only one in five nursing home 
      residents met minimal participation criteria, suggesting limited utility of the 
      SF-36 in nursing homes. Reliability and validity characteristics were fairly good. 
      Skewed scores were noted for some SF-36 scales. The utility of the SF-36 may be 
      limited to assessments of subjects with higher cognitive and physical functioning 
      than typical nursing home residents. The SF-36 might benefit from modification for 
      this setting, or by tests of proxy ratings.

TI  - Factors contributing to dehydration in nursing homes: inadequate staffing and lack 
      of professional supervision.
PG  - 1187-94
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors that influenced fluid intake among nursing 
      home residents who were not eating well. DESIGN: A prospective, descriptive, 
      anthropological study. SETTING: Two proprietary nursing homes with 105 and 138 beds, 
      respectively. PARTICIPANTS: Forty nursing home residents. MEASUREMENTS: Participant 
      observation, event analysis, bedside dysphagia screening, mental and functional 
      status evaluation, assessment of level of family/advocate involvement, and chart 
      review were used to collect data. Data were gathered on the amount of liquid served 
      and consumed over a 3- day period. Daily fluid intake was compared with three 
      established standards: Standard 1 (30 mL/kg body weight), Standard 2 (1 
      mL/kcal/energy consumed), and Standard 3 (100 mL/kg for the first 10 kg, 50 mL/kg 
      for the next 10 kg, 15 mL/kg for the remaining kg). RESULTS: The residents' mean 
      fluid intake was inadequate; 39 of the 40 residents consumed less than 1500 mL/day. 
      Using three established standards, we found that the fluid intake was inadequate for 
      nearly all of the residents. The amount of fluid consumed with and between meals was 
      low. Some residents took no fluids for extended periods of time, which resulted in 
      their fluid intake being erratic and inadequate even when it was resumed. Clinical 
      (undiagnosed dysphagia, cognitive and functional impairment, lack of pain 
      management), sociocultural (lack of social support, inability to speak English, and 
      lack of attention to individual beverage preferences), and institutional factors (an 
      inadequate number of knowledgeable staff and lack of supervision of certified 
      nursing assistants by professional staff) contributed to low fluid intake. During 
      the data collection, 25 of the 40 residents had illnesses/conditions that may have 
      been related to dehydration. CONCLUSIONS: When staffing is inadequate and 
      supervision is poor, residents with moderate to severe dysphagia, severe cognitive 
      and functional impairment, aphasia or inability to speak English, and a lack of 
      family or friends to assist them at mealtime are at great risk for dehydration. 
      Adequate fluid intake can be achieved by simple interventions such as offering 
      residents preferred liquids systematically and by having an adequate number of 
      supervised staff help them to drink while properly positioned.

TI  - Cosmetic surgery: surgical tools--psychosocial goals.
PG  - 101-11
AB  - What determines patients' goals for cosmetic surgery and their satisfaction with the 
      outcome? Historical trends, body image theory, evolutionary biology, and clinical 
      and experimental psychology each contribute answers. The physical changes that 
      patients seek are typically a means to psychosocial goals. Individual objectives 
      vary, but often share an origin in recurrent painful feelings, thoughts, or 
      experiences. Surgical goals include: (1) changes in emotional states or cognitions; 
      (2) improvement in interpersonal relationships; and (3) an altering of reactions of 
      the larger society. Psychological studies of cosmetic surgery patients have been 
      designed primarily to address two fundamental questions: (1) is there a preoperative 
      psychological profile of cosmetic surgery patients; and (2) does cosmetic surgery 
      produce enduring, beneficial psychological change? The use of specialized screening 
      interview questions, and effective collaboration with mental health providers, help 
      a wider range of patients achieve successful surgical outcomes.

TI  - Outcome states of colorectal cancer: identification and description using patient 
      focus groups.
PG  - 1491-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Utilities for the outcome states of colorectal cancer must be measured to 
      evaluate the cost-utility of screening and surveillance strategies for this disease. 
      We sought to identify these outcome states, define their associated areas of 
      morbidity, and construct representative descriptions of them for use in a utilities 
      assessment instrument. METHODS: We identified candidate colorectal cancer outcome 
      states based on a review of the literature and interviews with health care 
      professionals. We organized patient focus groups from each of the candidate outcome 
      states to examine their homogeneity and define their associated areas of morbidity. 
      After analyzing the focus group transcripts, we identified and described outcome 
      states of colorectal cancer for future incorporation into a utilities assessment 
      instrument. RESULTS: Six candidate outcome states of colorectal cancer were 
      identified based on disease stage and location at diagnosis. Thirty-eight patients 
      then participated in six focus groups. Analysis of the focus group transcripts 
      revealed seven areas of morbidity associated with colorectal cancer. These areas 
      included problems with social interaction and cognition, fear of cancer recurrence, 
      pain, fatigue, changes in bowel habits, and sexual dysfunction. Based on differences 
      in the intensity and frequency of the symptoms reported in each of these areas, 
      seven distinct outcome states of colorectal cancer were identified and described. 
      CONCLUSION: Clinically distinct outcome states of colorectal cancer are determined 
      by the stage and location of the cancer at the time of diagnosis. Descriptions of 
      these outcome states were created using data collected from patient focus groups. 
      These descriptions can be incorporated into a utilities assessment instrument.

TI  - Oncologists' recognition of depression in their patients with cancer.
PG  - 1594-600
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was performed as part of a large depression screening project in 
      cancer patients to determine the degree of physician recognition of levels of 
      depressive symptoms in cancer patients and to describe patient characteristics that 
      influence the accuracy of physician perception of depressive symptoms. METHODS: 
      Twenty-five ambulatory oncology clinics affiliated with Community Cancer Care, Inc 
      of Indiana enrolled and surveyed 1,109 subjects treated by 12 oncologists. Subjects 
      completed the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (ZSDS) and physicians were asked to 
      rate their patients' level of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and pain using numerical 
      rating scales. Subjects' sex, age, primary tumor type, medications, primary 
      caregiver, and disease stage at diagnosis were also recorded. RESULTS: Physician 
      ratings of depression were significantly associated with their patients' levels of 
      endorsement of depressive symptoms on the ZSDS. However, agreement between 
      physicians and patients is most frequently clustered when patients report little or 
      no depressive symptoms. While physician ratings are concordant with patient 
      endorsement of no significant depressive symptomatology 79% of the time, they are 
      only concordant 33% and 13% of the time in the mild-to-moderate/severe ranges, 
      respectively. Physician ratings were most influenced by patient endorsement of 
      frequent and obvious mood symptoms, ie, sadness, crying, and irritability. Physician 
      ratings also appeared to be influenced by medical correlates of patients' level of 
      depressive symptoms (functional status, stage of disease, and site of tumor). 
      Additionally, patients whose depression was inaccurately classified reported 
      significantly higher levels of pain and had higher levels of disability. Physicians' 
      ratings of depression were most highly correlated with physicians' ratings of 
      patients' anxiety and pain. CONCLUSION: Physicians' perceptions of depressive 
      symptoms in their patients are correlated with patient's ratings, but there is a 
      marked tendency to underestimate the level of depressive symptoms in patients who 
      are more depressed. They are most influenced by symptoms such as crying and 
      depressed mood, and medical factors that are useful, but not the most reliable, 
      indicators of depression in this population. Physicians' ratings of their patients' 
      distress symptoms seem to be global in nature--they are highly correlated with 
      anxiety, pain, and global dysfunction. Physician assessment might be improved if 
      they were instructed to assess and probe for the more reliable cognitive symptoms 
      such as anhedonia, guilt, suicidal thinking, and hopelessness. Screening instruments 
      and the use of brief follow-up interviews would help to identify patients who are 
      depressed.

TI  - Comparing neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation of competency in 
      rehabilitation: a case example.
PG  - 909-12
AB  - This report describes the case of a 20-year-old man who sustained a gunshot wound to 
      the forehead, resulting in traumatic brain injury and C2 ventilator-dependent 
      quadriplegia. Issues of personal control and autonomy typified his psychological 
      adjustment. The question of competency to refuse medical treatment arose when he 
      disallowed intervention for a suspected ear infection not confirmed by culture. 
      Subsequently, the patient was alternately described as incompetent by a psychiatrist 
      and competent by a medical ethics review panel. These decisions are interpreted 
      within the context of existing medical-legal literature and historical precedent of 
      competency in civil law. Central to competency evaluation is the patient's ability 
      to recognize that a decision-making process is required, to review the pros and cons 
      of various options, and to communicate a decision. Importantly, this decision need 
      not be in accordance with the opinion of family or the health care team. 
      Neuropsychological screening indicated the patient's cognitive abilities were within 
      functional limits, and he subsequently agreed to treatment after experiencing pain 
      and fever, and learning of a positive culture. It is concluded that a two-pronged 
      neuropsychological evaluation of competency based on the patient's information 
      processing capabilities is most appropriate in medical rehabilitation settings.

TI  - A critique of instruments and methods to detect, diagnose, and rate delirium.
PG  - 35-77
AB  - This document reviews existing instruments for evaluation of delirium. Instruments 
      have been grouped into four categories: tests that screen for cognitive impairment, 
      delirium diagnostic instruments, delirium-specific numerical rating scales, and 
      laboratory and paraclinical exams. Analysis of instruments was based on comparison 
      of their psychometric properties as well as subjective judgment. Guidelines are 
      suggested for choosing the appropriate instrument according to the type of clinical 
      evaluation or delirium research envisaged. Important factors in choosing an 
      instrument, besides the appropriateness of its psychometric characteristics, include 
      administration time constraints, level of rater expertise, and patient capabilities. 
      By familiarizing investigators with the variety of evaluation instruments available, 
      this work should permit more appropriate instrument selection in future studies on 
      delirium.

TI  - Self-rated psychiatric symptoms in patients operated on because of primary 
      hyperparathyroidism and in patients with long-standing mild hypercalcemia.
PG  - 72-8
AB  - Self-rated psychiatric symptoms were investigated in 30 patients referred for 
      surgery because of primary hyperparathyroidism (HPT) (serum calcium, 2.87 +/- 0.21 
      mmol/L) in 38 subjects detected in a health screening, with 15 years of mild 
      hypercalcemia and probable HPT (serum calcium, 2.66 +/- 0.09 mmol/L), and in 38 
      normocalcemic control subjects. The psychiatric symptomatology was evaluated by use 
      of the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-56), a self-rating symptom scale. The 
      patients with verified HPT had the highest mean HSCL score, 89.1 +/- 20.1 before 
      surgery, compared with 76.6 +/- 17.0 (p less than 0.01) in the health survey 
      hypercalcemic patients and 73.8 +/- 16.0 (p less than 0.001) in the controls. The 
      factors for anxiety, depression, and cognitive symptoms were the most pronounced in 
      the HPT patients and were also increased among the mildly hypercalcemic persons of 
      the health survey, compared with the controls. Somatic symptoms such as headache, 
      back pain, chest pain, and weakness were equally common in HPT and in the controls, 
      and measurements of isometric muscle strength of knee extension did not demonstrate 
      reduction of muscle strength in the health survey hypercalcemic patients. Follow-up 
      of the HPT patients 1 year after parathyroid surgery revealed a marked improvement 
      in mental health (HSCL score 73.2 +/- 13.7, p less than 0.001). In the health survey 
      hypercalcemic patients, neither the psychiatric symptomatology nor the muscle 
      strength were influenced by 6 months of oral vitamin D therapy (alphacalcidol). The 
      results demonstrate that psychiatric symptoms are experienced frequently by patients 
      with HPT and minimum to moderate increases in the serum calcium level and that these 
      disturbances are reversed by parathyroid surgery.

TI  - The cognitive arrest hypothesis of denial.
PG  - 47-58
AB  - This paper has presented a microanalysis of the psychic actions and processes 
      involved in the following four phases of the denial defence: (1) preconscious 
      appraisal of danger, (2) painful affect, (3) cognitive arrest, and (4) screen 
      behaviour. The subject's preconscious appraisal of some situation as actually or 
      potentially dangerous or traumatic brings about the formation of some painful 
      affect. The painful affect initiates a reaction in which the subject turns his focal 
      attention from whatever disturbs him to something less threatening. This turning 
      away or rejection of what is disturbing involves an arrest of the subject's 
      perceiving and/or thinking about the painful object. In the cognitive arrest phase, 
      the subject unconsciously in fantasy attacks the concrete representation of whatever 
      he considers to be the cause of his psychic pain. These fantasy attempts to destroy 
      the painful object arrest the subject's thinking at a primary process level. The 
      fantasy attacks on the painful object and the consequent cognitive arrest is 
      followed by screen behaviour. Screen behaviour is defined as the ideas, fantasies, 
      affects, and overt behaviours motivated by the need to fill in the gaps created by 
      the cognitive arrest, to substitute a different object relation for the one 
      subjectively lost, and to support the defensive aims of the preceding phase. 
      Auxiliary defences acting in conjunction with denial are frequently used in the 
      screen behaviour phase.

TI  - Does Vestibular-Ocular-Motor (VOM) Impairment Affect Time to Return to Play, Symptom 
      Severity, Neurocognition and Academic Ability in Student-Athletes following acute 
      Concussion?
PG  - 788-797
LID - 10.1080/02699052.2021.1911001 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Research indicates Sports-Related Concussion (SRC) impairs 
      Vestibular-Ocular-Motor (VOM) function. The aim was to explore if VOM impairment 
      correlates with longer Return To Play (RTP), symptom burden, neurocognitive 
      performance and academic capability.Participants: 40 (61.4% male) Loughborough 
      University, UK, rugby union student-athletes who sustained 42 SRCs.Methods: 
      Student-athletes completed an assessment battery during pre-season (baseline), 2, 4, 
      8 and 14 days post-SRC and prior to RTP and were managed according to the rugby 
      Football Union' community pathway.Outcome measures: Vestibular Ocular-Motor 
      Screening (VOMS), Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Test, 
      Post-Concussion Symptom Scale, Perceived Academic Impairment Tool questionnaire and 
      percentage of academic activities specifically missed due to SRC.Results: VOMS 
      scores were significantly (p < 0.005) greater than baseline at all time points 
      except RTP. Presence of VOM dysfunction at 14 days post-SRC significantly correlated 
      with a longer RTP, greater symptom burden and increased odds ratio at 2, 4 and 
      8 days and academic time loss at 2, 4 and 8 days post-SRC.Conclusion: VOM impairment 
      is associated with an increased symptom burden and impaired academic capability, and 
      a longer time to RTP when present at 14 days post-SRC.

AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinically stable older patients with 
      psychiatric disorders is unclear. This study examined the prevalence of depressive 
      and anxiety symptoms, and their associations with quality of life (QOL) in 
      clinically stable older patients with psychiatric disorders during the COVID-19 
      pandemic. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms, insomnia, pain, and QOL were assessed with standardized instruments. A 
      total of 1063 patients were included. The prevalence of depressive and anxiety 
      symptoms, and combined depressive and anxiety symptoms were 62.3% 
      (95%CI = 59.4-65.2%), 52.4% (95%CI = 49.3-55.4%), and 45.9% (95%CI = 42.9-48.9%), 
      respectively. Patients with depressive and anxiety symptoms had significantly lower 
      QOL than those without (P < 0.01). Binary logistic regression analyses revealed that 
      having depressive symptoms was positively associated with more severe insomnia 
      (OR = 1.29, P < 0.01) and pain (OR = 1.14, P < 0.01), and was negatively associated 
      with other psychiatric diagnoses (except for major depressive disorder, 
      schizophrenia, and organic mental disorder; OR = 0.50, P < 0.01), while having 
      anxiety symptoms was positively associated with severe physical diseases (OR = 1.57, 
      P = 0.02), poor adherence to treatment (OR = 1.50, P < 0.01), and more severe 
      insomnia (OR = 1.15, P < 0.01) and pain (OR = 1.11, P < 0.01). Having combined 
      depression and anxiety symptoms was positively associated with poor adherence to 
      treatment (OR = 1.42, P = 0.02) and more severe insomnia (OR = 1.19, P < 0.01) and 
      pain (OR = 1.15, P < 0.01), and was negatively associated with the diagnosis of 
      schizophrenia (OR = 0.50, P = 0.04) and others (OR = 0.53, P < 0.01). Depressive and 
      anxiety symptoms were common in clinically stable older patients with psychiatric 
      disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of these 
      symptoms on QOL, regular screening and appropriate treatment are recommended for 
      this population.

TI  - Attenuation of Pain Perception Induced by the Rubber Hand Illusion.

AB  - Adaptive behavior usually requires accurate representations of body positions and 
      ownership, which rely on integration of multiple sources of sensory information. The 
      rubber hand illusion (RHI) presents a compelling example demonstrating that the 
      combination of visual and tactile signals strongly influences the subjective 
      experience of body ownership. However, it still remains unclear how the perception 
      of body ownership in turn alters other aspects of sensory processing, such as pain 
      perception. In the present study, we examined whether the RHI could modulate the 
      subjective experience of pain. We set three conditions corresponding to different 
      levels of ownership of the rubber hand: the synchronous condition in which the 
      rubber and the real hand were simultaneously stroked; the asynchronous condition in 
      which the two hands were asynchronously stroked; the own-hand-only condition in 
      which only the real hand was stroked. Results from the screening experiment 
      indicated that subjects experienced the stronger RHI in the synchronous condition, 
      compared with the strength of RHI in the other two conditions. In the main 
      experiment, subjects were requested to report the intensity and unpleasantness of 
      pain evoked by laser stimuli under the three stroking conditions. Results showed 
      that pain ratings were significantly lower under the synchronous condition than 
      those under the other two conditions, suggesting the RHI could induce a significant 
      analgesic effect. Furthermore, the correlation analysis showed that the degree of 
      the analgesic effect was positively correlated with the RHI strength across 
      individuals. Taken together, these results suggest an analgesic effect of the RHI 
      and support the potential usage of visual illusions in future translational research 
      on pain.

TI  - Identification of small molecules that selectively inhibit diacylglycerol lipase-α 
      activity.
PG  - 595-605
LID - 10.1177/1087057113511111 [doi]
AB  - Recent genetic evidence suggests that the diacylglycerol lipase (DAGL-α) isoform is 
      the major biosynthetic enzyme for the most abundant endocannabinoid, 
      2-arachidonoyl-glycerol (2-AG), in the central nervous system. Revelation of its 
      essential role in regulating retrograde synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis 
      has made it an attractive therapeutic target. Therefore, it has become apparent that 
      selective inhibition of DAGL-α enzyme activity with a small molecule could be a 
      strategy for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of disease 
      indications such as depression, anxiety, pain, and cognition. In this report, the 
      authors present the identification of small-molecule inhibitor chemotypes of DAGL-α, 
      which were selective (≥10-fold) against two other lipases, pancreatic lipase and 
      monoacylglycerol lipase, via high-throughput screening of a diverse compound 
      collection. Seven chemotypes of interest from a list of 185 structural clusters, 
      which included 132 singletons, were initially selected for evaluation and 
      characterization. Selection was based on potency, selectivity, and chemical 
      tractability. One of the chemotypes, the glycine sulfonamide series, was prioritized 
      as an initial lead for further medicinal chemistry optimization.

TI  - Establishing a learned-helplessness effect paradigm in C57BL/6 mice: behavioural 
      evidence for emotional, motivational and cognitive effects of aversive 
      uncontrollability per se.
PG  - 358-72
LID - 10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.08.012 [doi]
AB  - Uncontrollability of major life events has been proposed to be central to depression 
      onset and maintenance. The learned helplessness (LH) effect describes a deficit in 
      terminating controllable aversive stimuli in individuals that experienced aversive 
      stimuli as uncontrollable relative to individuals that experienced the same stimuli 
      as controllable. The LH effect translates across species and therefore can provide 
      an objective-valid readout in animal models of depression. Paradigms for a robust LH 
      effect are established and currently applied in rat but there are few reports of 
      prior and current study of the LH effect in mouse. This includes the C57BL/6 mouse, 
      typically the strain of choice for application of molecular-genetic tools in 
      pre-clinical depression research. The aims of this study were to develop a robust 
      paradigm for the LH effect in BL/6 mice, provide evidence for underlying 
      psychological processes, and study the effect of a depression-relevant genotype on 
      the LH effect. The apparatus used for in/escapable electro-shock exposure and escape 
      test was a two-way shuttle arena with continuous automated measurement of 
      locomotion, compartment transfers, e-shock escapes, vertical activity and freezing. 
      Brother-pairs of BL/6 mice were allocated to either escapable e-shocks (ES) or 
      inescapable e-shocks (IS), with escape latencies of the ES brother used as e-shock 
      durations for the IS brother. The standard two-way shuttle paradigm was modified: 
      the central gate was replaced by a raised divider and e-shock escape required 
      transfer to the distal part of the safe compartment. These refinements yielded 
      reduced superstitious, pre-adaptive e-shock transfers in IS mice and thereby 
      increased the LH effect. To obtain a robust LH effect in all brother pairs, 
      pre-screening for minor between-brother ES differences was necessary and did not 
      confound the LH effect. IS mice developed reduced motor responses to e-shock, 
      consistent with a motivational deficit, and absence of a learning curve for escapes 
      at escape test, consistent with a cognitive deficit. When a tone CS was used to 
      predict e-shock, IS mice exhibited increased reactivity to the CS, consistent with 
      hyper-emotionality. There was no ES-IS difference in pain sensitivity. Mice 
      heterozygous knockout for the 5-HTT gene exhibited an increased LH effect relative 
      to wildtype mice. This mouse model will allow for the detailed molecular study of 
      the aetiology, psychology, neurobiology and neuropharmacology of uncontrollability 
      of aversive stimuli, a potential major aetiological factor and state marker in 
      depression. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Anxiety and 
      Depression'.

TI  - Occupational health of miners at altitude: adverse health effects, toxic exposures, 
      pre-placement screening, acclimatization, and worker surveillance.
PG  - 629-40
LID - 10.3109/15563650.2011.607169 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Mining operations conducted at high altitudes provide health challenges for 
      workers as well as for medical personnel. OBJECTIVE: To review the literature 
      regarding adverse health effects and toxic exposures that may be associated with 
      mining operations conducted at altitude and to discuss pre-placement screening, 
      acclimatization issues, and on-site surveillance strategies. METHODS: We used the 
      Ovid ( http://ovidsp.tx.ovid.com ) search engine to conduct a MEDLINE search for 
      "coal mining" or "mining" and "altitude sickness" or "altitude" and a second MEDLINE 
      search for "occupational diseases" and "altitude sickness" or "altitude." The search 
      identified 97 articles of which 76 were relevant. In addition, the references of 
      these 76 articles were manually reviewed for relevant articles. CARDIOVASCULAR 
      EFFECTS: High altitude is associated with increased sympathetic tone that may result 
      in elevated blood pressure, particularly in workers with pre-existing hypertension. 
      Workers with a history of coronary artery disease experience ischemia at lower work 
      rates at high altitude, while those with a history of congestive heart failure have 
      decreased exercise tolerance at high altitude as compared to healthy controls and 
      are at higher risk of suffering an exacerbation of their heart failure. PULMONARY 
      EFFECTS: High altitude is associated with various adverse pulmonary effects, 
      including high-altitude pulmonary edema, pulmonary hypertension, subacute mountain 
      sickness, and chronic mountain sickness. Mining at altitude has been reported to 
      accelerate silicosis and other pneumoconioses. Miners with pre-existing 
      pneumoconioses may experience an exacerbation of their condition at altitude. 
      Persons traveling to high altitude have a higher incidence of Cheyne-Stokes 
      respiration while sleeping than do persons native to high altitude. Obesity 
      increases the risk of pulmonary hypertension, acute mountain sickness, and 
      sleep-disordered breathing. NEUROLOGICAL EFFECTS: The most common adverse 
      neurological effect of high altitude is acute mountain sickness, while the most 
      severe adverse neurological effect is high-altitude cerebral edema. Poor sleep 
      quality and sleep-disordered breathing may contribute to daytime sleepiness and 
      impaired cognitive performance that could potentially result in workplace injuries, 
      particularly in miners who are already at increased risk of suffering unintentional 
      workplace injuries. OPHTHALMOLOGICAL EFFECTS: Adverse ophthalmological effects 
      include increased exposure to ultraviolet light and xerophthalmia, which may be 
      further exacerbated by occupational dust exposure. RENAL EFFECTS: High altitude is 
      associated with a protective effect in patients with renal disease, although it is 
      unknown how this would affect miners with a history of chronic renal disease from 
      exposure to silica and other renal toxicants. HEMATOLOGICAL EFFECTS: Advanced age 
      increases the risk of erythrocytosis and chronic mountain sickness in miners. 
      Thrombotic and thromboembolic events are also more common at high altitude. 
      MUSCULOSKELETAL EFFECTS: Miners are at increased risk for low back pain due to 
      occupational factors, and the easy fatigue at altitude has been reported to further 
      predispose workers to this disorder. TOXIC EXPOSURES: Diesel emissions at altitude 
      contain more carbon monoxide due to increased incomplete combustion of fuel. In 
      addition, a given partial pressure of carbon monoxide at altitude will result in a 
      larger percentage of carboxyhemoglobin at altitude. Miners with a diagnosis of 
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may be at higher risk for morbidity from 
      exposure to diesel exhaust at altitude. CONCLUSIONS: Both mining and work at 
      altitude have independently been associated with a number of adverse health effects, 
      although the combined effect of mining activities and high altitude has not been 
      adequately studied. Careful selection of workers, appropriate acclimatization, and 
      limited on-site surveillance can help control most health risks. Further research is 
      necessary to more completely understand the risks of mining at altitude and 
      delineate what characteristics of potential employees put them at risk for 
      altitude-related morbidity or mortality.

TI  - Head and neck specific Health Related Quality of Life scores predict subsequent 
      survival in successfully treated head and neck cancer patients: a prospective cohort 
      study.
PG  - 974-9
LID - 10.1016/j.oraloncology.2011.07.010 [doi]
AB  - To examine the survival prediction of head and neck (H&N) Health Related Quality of 
      Life (HRQoL) scores among successfully treated and cognitive functioning H&N 
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. Through structured interviews, 
      self-reported questionnaires were given to 139 successfully treated HNSCC patients, 
      67 ± 32 months following diagnosis. HRQoL-scores, measured with the EORTC QLQ-H&N35 
      inventory, self-reported levels of neuroticism, avoidance focused coping, coping by 
      suppression of competing activity, alcohol consumption, smoking status, and heart 
      and lung disease, as well as gender, age, TNM-stage, and tumor site were determined. 
      The mean observation period was 75 ± 4 months among the survivors. Twenty-four 
      deaths were observed. A EORTC QLQ-H&N 35 sum score, including a dichotomized version 
      (HR 2.73-3.67), was predictive of survival, both directly and after adjustment for 
      all of the above mentioned variables. The H&N HRQoL indices "feeling ill", 
      "sexuality", "open mouth", "swallowing", and "pain" specifically predicted survival. 
      The dichotomized H&N HRQoL sum score compared the 4th upper quartile to the three 
      lower quartiles, and a cut off value of 28.5 was designated. Analyses demonstrated 
      that a high risk group with 33% mortality may include only one quarter of the 
      patient population as opposed to 12.5% mortality among the other patients. Our 
      findings indicate a unique survival prediction from EORTC QLQ-H&N 35 sum scores in 
      successfully treated HNSCC patients. HRQoL scores, in particular, related to oral 
      health, predicted survival. Furthermore, HRQoL-scores may be a screening tool for 
      identifying patients with high mortality risk.

TI  - Primary care providers' perspectives on psychoactive medication disorders in older 
      adults.
PG  - 164-72
LID - 10.1016/j.amjopharm.2011.04.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Compared with younger adults, older adults consume a disproportionate 
      percentage of pain and sleep medications. Some studies have reported that 
      psychoactive medication misuse and abuse in older populations is a significant 
      problem. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to understand the perspective of 
      primary care providers (PCPs) regarding the extent and clinical presentations of 
      misuse and abuse of psychoactive medications in older patients and to explore PCPs' 
      perceived barriers to identifying affected individuals. METHODS: Seventeen 
      physicians and 5 nurse practitioners from 2 ambulatory care practices serving older 
      adults in New York City participated in this study. Six focus group discussions were 
      audiotaped and transcribed. Two raters coded transcripts to identify recurring 
      themes. Qualitative analysis software was employed for data coding and sorting 
      purposes. RESULTS: Although PCPs indicated that only a small percentage of older 
      patients were actively misusing or abusing their psychoactive medications (average 
      estimate given by providers, 8%), they felt that these patients placed significant 
      time burdens on them. Perceived risk factors included psychiatric disorders, 
      previous substance abuse history, and cognitive impairment, but many PCPs found it 
      impossible to predict which patients were at increased risk. PCPs identified 
      multiple barriers to identifying affected patients, including lack of communication 
      (between provider and patient, provider and patients' caregivers, and between 
      different providers), nonspecific symptoms, and the lack of a clear definition of 
      misuse and abuse. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of a clear definition, absence of 
      well-defined risk factors, and ambiguous clinical manifestations of psychoactive 
      medication misuse and abuse present substantial barriers to diagnosis. A standard, 
      age-appropriate definition could help PCPs establish a diagnosis, clarify what 
      constitutes appropriate psychoactive medication use, define the extent of the 
      problem, and pave the way for the development of effective screening and diagnostic 
      tools.

TI  - Adaptive physical activity and back pain: a non-randomised community-based 
      intervention trial.
PG  - 543-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Back pain is a significant problem due to the high healthcare 
      utilization, rising costs of care and low effectiveness of many current treatments. 
      AIM: Aim of this study was to determine the effects of a community-based Adapted 
      Physical Activity (APA) program focused on chronic, non-specific back pain. DESIGN: 
      Open-label intervention study. SETTING: Community. POPULATION: All patients admitted 
      to Empoli Rehabilitation Department for non-specific back pain for at least three 
      months, were considered for APA. Exclusion criteria were: "red flags", 
      difficulty/disability in basic daily living activities, severe/acute medical 
      conditions, acute pain, psychiatric disease or cognitive impairment, severe 
      visuoauditory deficit. Overall, 650 persons were enrolled. METHODS: The APA program, 
      including strength and flexibility training and exercises for improving posture was 
      delivered for 12 months, with 1-hour group classes three times per week. RESULTS: 
      Overall 261 (40.2%) subjects completed the 12-month APA program and were compared to 
      the 310 (47.7%) who were screened but failed to initiate or complete the study. 
      There were no significant differences in baseline demographic and clinical 
      characteristics between groups. Patients who followed the APA program reported 
      significantly improved health status and significant back pain improvement, compared 
      with those who did not adhere to the program. In the logistic regression analysis 
      adjusted for age and gender, a distance from home to gymnasium greater than the 
      median for the study population (2.6 km) was the only baseline characteristic 
      significantly associated with an increased risk of non-adherence (OR 1.44, 95%CI 
      1.01-2.13; P=0.04). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that a community-based APA 
      program can improve back pain and health status in persons with chronic, 
      non-specific low back pain. CLINICA REHABILITATION IMPACT: These findings highlight 
      the potential for new approaches to manage chronic disease and disability by 
      facilitating a healthy lifestyle and promoting physical activity through 
      implementation of community-based exercise programs.

TI  - Using electrophysiology and in silico three-dimensional modeling to reduce human 
      Ether-à-go-go related gene K(+) channel inhibition in a histamine H3 receptor 
      antagonist program.
PG  - 781-9
LID - 10.1089/adt.2010.0322 [doi]
AB  - The histamine H3 receptor (H3R) plays a regulatory role in the presynaptic release 
      of histamine and several other neurotransmitters, and thus, it is an attractive 
      target for central nervous system indications including cognitive disorders, 
      narcolepsy, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and pain. The development of 
      H3R antagonists was complicated by the similarities between the pharmacophores of 
      H3R and human Ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) channel blockers, a fact that 
      probably prevented promising compounds from being progressed into the clinic. Using 
      a three-dimensional in silico modeling approach complemented with automated and 
      manual patch clamping, we were able to separate these two pharmacophores and to 
      develop highly potent H3R antagonists with reduced risk of hERG liabilities from 
      initial hit series with low selectivity identified in a high-throughput screening 
      campaign.

PG  - 2018-31

AB  - Sickle-cell disease is one of the most common severe monogenic disorders in the 
      world. Haemoglobin polymerisation, leading to erythrocyte rigidity and 
      vaso-occlusion, is central to the pathophysiology of this disease, although the 
      importance of chronic anaemia, haemolysis, and vasculopathy has been established. 
      Clinical management is basic and few treatments have a robust evidence base. One of 
      the main problems of sickle-cell disease in children is the development of 
      cerebrovascular disease and cognitive impairment, and the role of blood transfusion 
      and hydroxycarbamide for prevention of these complications is starting to be 
      understood. Recurrent episodes of vaso-occlusion and inflammation result in 
      progressive damage to most organs, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, bones, and 
      cardiovascular system, which becomes apparent with increasing age. Most people with 
      sickle-cell disease live in Africa, where little is known about this disease; 
      however, we do know that the disorder follows a more severe clinical course in 
      Africa than for the rest of the world and that infectious diseases have a role in 
      causing this increased severity of sickle-cell disease. More work is needed to 
      develop effective treatments that specifically target pathophysiological changes and 
      clinical complications of sickle-cell disease.

TI  - Discovery and characterization of non-ATP site inhibitors of the mitogen activated 
      protein (MAP) kinases.
PG  - 234-44
LID - 10.1021/cb1002619 [doi]
AB  - Inhibition of protein kinases has validated therapeutic utility for cancer, with at 
      least seven kinase inhibitor drugs on the market. Protein kinase inhibition also has 
      significant potential for a variety of other diseases, including diabetes, pain, 
      cognition, and chronic inflammatory and immunologic diseases. However, as the vast 
      majority of current approaches to kinase inhibition target the highly conserved 
      ATP-binding site, the use of kinase inhibitors in treating nononcology diseases may 
      require great selectivity for the target kinase. As protein kinases are signal 
      transducers that are involved in binding to a variety of other proteins, targeting 
      alternative, less conserved sites on the protein may provide an avenue for greater 
      selectivity. Here we report an affinity-based, high-throughput screening technique 
      that allows nonbiased interrogation of small molecule libraries for binding to all 
      exposed sites on a protein surface. This approach was used to screen both the c-Jun 
      N-terminal protein kinase Jnk-1 (involved in insulin signaling) and p38α (involved 
      in the formation of TNFα and other cytokines). In addition to canonical ATP-site 
      ligands, compounds were identified that bind to novel allosteric sites. The nature, 
      biological relevance, and mode of binding of these ligands were extensively 
      characterized using two-dimensional (1)H/(13)C NMR spectroscopy, protein X-ray 
      crystallography, surface plasmon resonance, and direct enzymatic activity and 
      activation cascade assays. Jnk-1 and p38α both belong to the MAP kinase family, and 
      the allosteric ligands for both targets bind similarly on a ledge of the protein 
      surface exposed by the MAP insertion present in the CMGC family of protein kinases 
      and distant from the active site. Medicinal chemistry studies resulted in an 
      improved Jnk-1 ligand able to increase adiponectin secretion in human adipocytes and 
      increase insulin-induced protein kinase PKB phosphorylation in human hepatocytes, in 
      similar fashion to Jnk-1 siRNA and to rosiglitazone treatment. Together, the data 
      suggest that these new ligand series bind to a novel, allosteric, and 
      physiologically relevant site and therefore represent a unique approach to identify 
      kinase inhibitors.

TI  - The influence of psychological factors on pre-operative levels of pain intensity, 
      disability and health-related quality of life in lumbar spinal fusion surgery 
      patients.
PG  - 213-21

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the extent to which perceived pain and psychological factors 
      explain levels of disability and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients 
      scheduled for lumbar fusion surgery, and to test the hypothesis that relationships 
      between pain intensity, mental health, fear of movement/(re)injury, disability and 
      HRQOL are mediated by cognitive beliefs and appraisals. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, 
      correlation study. SETTING: Orthopaedic outpatient setting in a tertiary hospital. 
      PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and seven chronic back pain patients scheduled for lumbar 
      fusion surgery. MEASURES: Visual analogue scale for pain intensity, Short Form 36 
      mental health subscale, Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, Back Beliefs Questionnaire, 
      Self-efficacy Scale, Coping Strategy Questionnaire, Oswestry Disability Index and 
      European Quality of Life Questionnaire. RESULTS: The group effect of multiple 
      mediators significantly influenced the relationships between pain intensity and 
      mental health, fear of movement/(re)injury, functional disability and HRQOL. Pain 
      catastrophising significantly mediated the relationship between pain intensity and 
      mental health, control over pain significantly mediated the relationship between 
      mental health and functional disability, self-efficacy and pain outcome expectancy 
      significantly mediated the relationship between mental health and HRQOL, and 
      self-efficacy also significantly mediated the relationship between pain intensity, 
      fear of movement/(re)jury and functional disability. The model explained 28, 30, 52 
      and 42% of the variation in mental health, fear of movement/(re)injury, functional 
      disability and HRQOL, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the strong 
      influence and mediation roles of psychological factors on pain, mental health, fear 
      of movement/(re)injury, disability and HRQOL in patients scheduled for lumber 
      fusion. Future research should focus on screening as well as pre- and post-operative 
      interventions based on these psychological factors for the potential improvement of 
      lumber fusion surgery outcomes.

TI  - Regional gray matter density changes in brains of patients with irritable bowel 
      syndrome.
PG  - 48-57.e2
LID - 10.1053/j.gastro.2010.03.049 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Several studies have examined structural brain changes associated 
      with chronic pain syndromes, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but study 
      sample sizes have been small and heterogeneous. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance 
      imaging-based techniques, voxel-based morphometry, and cortical thickness analysis 
      to examine brain anatomical differences in a relatively large, tightly screened 
      sample of IBS patients (n = 55); we compared data with that from healthy persons 
      (controls; n = 48). RESULTS: IBS was associated with decreased gray matter density 
      (GMD) in widespread areas of the brain, including medial prefrontal and 
      ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, ventral striatum, and 
      thalamus. Compared with controls, we observed increased GMD in patients with IBS in 
      the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as 
      trends in the posterior insula/secondary somatosensory cortex, (para)hippocampus, 
      and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In accounting for anxiety and depression, 
      we found that several of the regions involved in affective processing no longer 
      differed between patients with IBS and controls, whereas the differences in 
      prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices remained. The areas of decreased GMD 
      associated with IBS were largely consistent across clinical subgroups, based on 
      predominant bowel habit and pain predominance of symptoms. No overall or regional 
      differences were observed in cortical thickness between patients with IBS and 
      controls. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in density of gray matter among regions involved in 
      cognitive/evaluative functions are specifically observed in patients with IBS, 
      whereas changes in other areas of the brain can be explained by levels of anxiety 
      and depression.

TI  - Reducing delirium in elderly patients with hip fracture: a multi-factorial 
      intervention study.
PG  - 678-88
LID - 10.1111/j.1399-6576.2010.02232.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an evident need for improved management of elderly patients 
      with trauma in order to avoid common and troublesome complications such as delirium. 
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether an implementation of a 
      multi-factorial program including intensified pre-hospital and perioperative 
      treatment and care could reduce the incidence of delirium in elderly patients with 
      hip fracture, cognitively intact at admission to the hospital. In addition, we 
      explored the factors that characterize patients who developed delirium. METHODS: A 
      prospective, quasi-experimental design was used. A total of 263 patients with hip 
      fracture (> or = 65 years), cognitively intact at admission, were consecutively 
      included between April 2003 and April 2004. On 1 October 2003, a new program was 
      introduced. All patients were screened for cognitive impairment within 30 min after 
      admission to the emergency department using The Short Portable Mental Status 
      Questionnaire (SPMSQ). To screen for delirium, patients were tested within 4 h of 
      admission and thereafter daily, using the Organic Brain Syndrome scale. RESULTS: The 
      number of patients who developed delirium during hospitalization was 74 (28.1%), 
      with a decrease from 34% (45 of 132) in the control group to 22% (29 of 131) in the 
      intervention group (P=0.031). Patients who developed delirium were statistically 
      older, more often had > 4 prescribed drugs at admission and scored less well in the 
      SPMSQ test. CONCLUSION: The use of a multi-factorial intervention program in elderly 
      hip fracture patients, lucid at admission, reduced the incidence of delirium during 
      hospitalization by 35%.

TI  - Evaluating the dimensionality of perceived cognitive function.
PG  - 982-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2008.07.012 [doi]
AB  - Decrements in cognitive function are common in cancer patients and other clinical 
      populations. As direct neuropsychological testing is often not feasible or 
      affordable, there is potential utility in screening for deficits that may warrant a 
      more comprehensive neuropsychological assessment. Furthermore, some evidence 
      suggests that perceived cognitive function (PCF) is independently associated with 
      structural and functional changes on neuroimagery, and may precede more overt 
      deficits. To appropriately measure PCF, one must understand its components and the 
      underlying dimensional structure. The purpose of this study was to examine the 
      dimensionality of PCF in people with cancer. The sample included 393 cancer patients 
      from four clinical trials who completed a questionnaire consisting of the 
      prioritized areas of concerns identified by patients and clinicians: self-reported 
      mental acuity, concentration, memory, verbal fluency, and functional interference. 
      Each area contained both negatively worded (i.e., deficit) and positively worded 
      (i.e., capability) items. Data were analyzed by using Cronbach's alpha, item-total 
      correlations, one-factor confirmatory factor analysis, and a bi-factor analysis 
      model. Results indicated that perceived cognitive problem items are distinct from 
      cognitive capability items, supporting a two-factor structure of PCF. Scoring of PCF 
      based on these two factors should lead to improved assessment of PCF for people with 
      cancer.

PG  - 313-9
LID - 10.1016/j.seizure.2008.11.010 [doi]
AB  - Spontaneous complaints of outpatients with focal epilepsy often stress the 
      relationship between cognitive deficits and Quality of Life (QOL). Consequently, the 
      aim of the present study was to find the best neuropsychological predictors of QOL 
      in individuals with focal epilepsy, in order to guide their ambulatory health care. 
      A sample of 71 Portuguese patients was studied: 40 female, 47 married, with a mean 
      age of 37.48 years (S.D.=11.79, 16-62), mean education of 7.93 (S.D.=4.05, 3-17), 
      and focal epilepsy of moderate severity. A Socio-demographic and Clinical 
      Questionnaire, the SF-36 v1, the Cognitive Functioning Scale from the ESI-55, a 
      Seizure Control scale (items from the Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale), and several 
      neuropsychological tests were used. Semantic Fluency was the only predictor of 
      Physical Functioning, Role Functioning - Physical, and Mental Health; I.A. Test 
      predicted Bodily Pain; and Attentive Matrices predicted General Health, Vitality, 
      and Role Functioning - Emotional. The Mental Component of the SF-36 v1 was predicted 
      by Attentive Matrices, and the Physical Component was predicted by Semantic Fluency. 
      Cognitive Functioning was predicted by the Token Test. Social Functioning and 
      Seizure Control presented no statistically significant correlation with the 
      neuropsychological indicators used. These results underscore the importance of 
      cognitive performance to the QOL of individuals with focal epilepsy, supporting the 
      systematic screening of cognitive performance in this population. Additionally, they 
      suggest cognitive rehabilitation has the potential to improve these individuals' 
      QOL.

TI  - The utility of the Beck Depression Inventory in a bariatric surgery population.
PG  - 426-31
LID - 10.1007/s11695-008-9717-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is commonly used in bariatric 
      surgery psychological assessments. However, several items may be measuring physical 
      consequences of obesity (e.g., sleep disturbance, chronic pain, or sexual 
      dysfunction) rather than depressive symptoms. METHODS: Bariatric surgery candidates 
      (n = 210) completed a series of assessments including the BDI, a chronic pain 
      assessment, and a semistructured clinical interview. Total BDI scores, subscale 
      scores, and endorsement patterns of somatic versus cognitive-affective items were 
      examined based on (1) the presence or absence of a depressive diagnosis or (2) the 
      presence or absence of chronic pain, and optimal cut points were determined. 
      RESULTS: Both the total BDI and cognitive-affective subscale had good discriminating 
      accuracy between participants with and without depression, with an optimal cut point 
      of 12 for the BDI and 7 for the cognitive-affective subscale. Bariatric surgery 
      candidates with chronic pain had significantly higher mean total scores on the BDI 
      (M = 12.5 +/- 7.5) than those without chronic pain (M = 9.02 +/- 6.7; p < 0.01), and 
      those with chronic pain were significantly more likely to endorse many of the 
      physical items than those without chronic pain. CONCLUSIONS: The BDI, with or 
      without the somatic items, appears to be a reasonable screening measure for 
      depressive symptoms among bariatric surgery candidates and the subpopulation of 
      those with chronic pain, although future investigations may wish to examine whether 
      other measures would have improved discrimination accuracy.

TI  - At the tipping point: predicting severe mobility difficulty in vulnerable older 
      women.
PG  - 1417-23
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2008.01819.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify clinical measures that aid detection of impending severe 
      mobility difficulty in older women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort 
      study. SETTING: Urban community in Baltimore, Maryland. PARTICIPANTS: One thousand 
      two community-dwelling, moderate to severely disabled women aged 65 and older in the 
      Women's Health and Aging Study I. MEASUREMENTS: Self-report and performance measures 
      representing six domains necessary for mobility: central and peripheral nervous 
      systems, muscles, bones and joints, perception, and energy. Severe mobility 
      difficulty was defined as usual gait of 0.5 m/s or less, any reported difficulty 
      walking across a small room, or dependence on a walking aid during a 4-m walking 
      test. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-seven out of 984 (47%) had severe mobility 
      difficulty at baseline, and 104/474 (22%) developed it within 12 months. Baseline 
      mobility difficulty was correlated with poor vision, knee pain, feelings of 
      helplessness, inability to stand with feet side by side for 10 seconds, difficulty 
      keeping balance while dressing or walking, inability to rise from a chair five 
      times, and cognitive impairment. Of these, knee pain (odds ratio (OR)=1.74, 95% 
      confidence interval (CI)=1.05-2.89), helplessness (OR=1.87, 95% CI=1.10-3.24), poor 
      vision (OR=2.03, 95% CI=1.06-3.89), inability to rise from a chair five times 
      (OR=2.50, 95% CI=1.15-5.41), and cognitive impairment (OR=4.75, 95% CI=1.67-13.48) 
      predicted incident severe mobility difficulty within 12 months, independent of age. 
      CONCLUSION: Five simple measures may aid identification of disabled older women at 
      high risk of severe mobility difficulty. Further studies should determine 
      generalizability to men and higher-functioning individuals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The heterogeneity of patients regarding pain-related 
      cognitive-behavioral mechanisms, such as pain-avoidance and pain-persistence 
      patterns, has been proposed to underlie varying treatment outcomes in patients with 
      fibromyalgia (FM). PURPOSE: To investigate the validity of a screening instrument to 
      discriminate between pain-persistence and pain-avoidance patterns in FM. METHOD: In 
      a three-part study, a self-reported screening instrument that assesses 
      pain-avoidance behavior was used to distinguish patients with pain-persistence and 
      pain-avoidance patterns. The resultant groups were compared with regard to several 
      pain-related cognitive-behavioral factors, performance on a physical fitness test, 
      and with regard to the judgments of trained therapists based on a semi-structured 
      interview. RESULTS: The validity of the screening instrument to distinguish between 
      pain-avoidance and pain-persistence patterns was supported by other validated 
      self-report questionnaires for pain-related cognitive-behavioral factors, physical 
      exercise tests, as well as by a high correspondence with blinded therapist judgment 
      after intake assessments. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that a short 
      self-report screening instrument can be used to distinguish between pain-avoidance 
      and pain-persistence patterns within the heterogeneous population of FM patients, 
      which offers promising possibilities to improve treatment efficacy by tailoring 
      treatment to specific patient patterns.

TI  - Symptom screening in detection of occupational solvent-related encephalopathy.
PG  - 343-55
LID - 10.1007/s00420-008-0341-1 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sensitive and easily applicable methods are needed for early detection 
      of central nervous system adverse effects related to occupational solvent exposure. 
      The present study evaluates how symptom screening works in practice. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 2,000 construction workers, 
      including painters and carpenters, in Finland. Scores were calculated for symptoms 
      relevant for chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE). Responses on exposure and health 
      were compared between subjects with high score (N = 28) and all other respondents. 
      The respondents with the highest scores, regardless of their occupation and 
      exposure, were invited for clinical examination to investigate the aetiologies of 
      the symptoms. If the examination resulted in a suspicion of CSE, a multidisciplinary 
      differential diagnostic follow-up procedure was performed. RESULTS: The respondents 
      with highest symptom scores were more exposed to solvents than those with lower 
      scores (P < 0.001) and reported more often physician-diagnosed diseases, especially 
      psychiatric disorders (P < 0.001). They also consumed more alcohol (P = 0.005) and 
      were more often unemployed or unable to work (P < 0.001). In the clinical 
      examination, sleep disturbances, somatic disorders, depression, unemployment, and 
      alcohol use were commonly found in addition to considerable solvent exposure history 
      and clinical neurological findings. Further examinations and a diagnostic follow-up 
      verified three cases of encephalopathy. One case was a CSE, an occupational disease. 
      The other two encephalopathy cases had multifactorial aetiology including solvents. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Screening in active workforce for symptoms of cognitive dysfunction 
      identifies highly solvent-exposed workers and also reveals occupational and 
      non-occupational cases of encephalopathy. Evaluation of differential diagnostic 
      conditions is essential in the detection of CSE. A stepwise model is proposed.

LID - 10.1007/s00415-008-0543-1 [doi]
AB  - We investigated the self-perceived health status among multiple sclerosis (MS) 
      patients with no or mild disability according to the Expanded Disability Status 
      Scale (EDSS) and the impact of self-rated physical functioning. A sample of fully 
      ambulatory (EDSS < or = 3.5) consecutive patients with MS was included after 
      screening for major cognitive impairment. The EDSS was used to measure nervous 
      system signs or disability, and the self-rated health status was assessed using the 
      SF-36 Health Survey. The normative SF-36 data for the general population of Italy 
      were used for comparison. The 197 MS patients analyzed (150 women and 47 men) had 
      significantly lower mean SF-36 scores than the general population, except for bodily 
      pain. The scores did not differ significantly by gender. The same analysis performed 
      on a subsample of 105 patients (79 women and 26 men) with minimal disability in one 
      functional system (EDSS < or = 2.0) yielded similar results. EDSS was weakly 
      correlated with the physical functioning subscale and explained only 2% of the 
      variance in the physical functioning subscale. The regression of the physical 
      functioning subscale on the other seven SF-36 subscales was significantly lower 
      among MS patients than in the general population for all subscales, except for role 
      limitation due to physical health problems and social functioning. Neither disease 
      course nor duration correlated significantly with SF-36 subscales. The SF-36 
      physical functioning subscale seemed to indicate physical functioning more 
      sensitively than EDSS. These findings should encourage the implementation of 
      specific strategies aimed at improving the quality of the self-perceived health 
      status already in the early disease stage.

TI  - Development and testing of a modified version of the brief pain inventory for use in 
      residential aged care facilities.
PG  - 301-6
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2007.01546.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A two-phase study was conducted to refine a version of Cleeland's Brief 
      Pain Inventory (BPI, Short Form) for use in residential aged care facilities 
      (RACFs). DESIGN: The Australian Pain Society modified Cleeland's BPI by changing 
      numerical response options to word descriptors. In Phase I, this version was tested 
      in RACFs to determine the feasibility of its use, its stability over time, and its 
      internal consistency reliability. Minor modifications resulted. In Phase II, the 
      refined version was abbreviated, and the internal consistency reliability of this 
      Modified Residents' Verbal BPI was examined. SETTING: RACFs. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Thirty-three residents of RACFs in Phase I, 149 in Phase II. INTERVENTION: The study 
      revised and abbreviated the BPI to better fit it for use in RACFs, examining the 
      reliability of the tool. MEASUREMENTS: Mini-Mental State Examination, Global 
      Deterioration Scale, modified BPI. RESULTS: The abbreviated tool comprises three 
      items assessing pain intensity and three assessing pain interference. It also 
      includes an item to specify pain location and a movement protocol. Cronbach alpha 
      coefficient for six intensity and interference items was 0.72 (N=106). CONCLUSION: 
      This abbreviated tool requires further testing but has demonstrated adequate 
      internal consistency reliability and is a brief, multidimensional tool that appears 
      feasible for assessing pain in RACFs, including use with residents who have some 
      cognitive impairment. It shows promise as a screening tool and may be useful to 
      assess the effectiveness of pain relief interventions and to measure pain 
      prevalence.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in cancer pain patients receiving opioids: a pilot study.
PG  - 49-57
LID - 10.1097/01.NCC.0000305673.06211.cd [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to compare cognitive function of cancer pain patients being given 
      opioids during their cancer treatment (n = 14) with that of patients receiving 
      treatment without opioids (n = 12). Correlations between cognitive function, pain 
      intensity, and opioid dose were analyzed. Patients were assessed 3 times in a 
      1-month period, using the Trail-Making Test, Mini-Mental State Examination, Digit 
      Span, and Brief Cognitive Screening Battery. Opioid use was not associated with 
      clear cognitive impairment. Patients being treated without opioids did perform 
      better in the Digit Span Test reverse-order test (P = .029) and the clock drawing 
      test (P = .023), but the differences arose in just 1 assessment in each case. Pain 
      intensity correlated negatively with scores in the Mini-Mental State Examination (P 
      = .001) and some Brief Cognitive Screening Battery tests (incidental recall, 
      immediate recall, and late recall; P <or= .042) in the group receiving opioids. 
      Opioid dose did not correlate with any of the measures of cognitive performance. 
      However, the patients with the worst performance scores were those with more severe 
      pain. Further studies are needed to clearly distinguish between the effects of 
      opioids versus the effects of pain.

TI  - Diagnostic evaluation using whole-body technetium bone scan in children with 
      cerebral palsy and pain.
PG  - 112-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pain in noncommunicative children can be difficult to localize and 
      diagnose. The purpose of this study is to report our experience using a 3-phase 
      whole-body technetium bone scan as a screening tool in identifying the source of 
      persistent pain in children with profound disabilities who cannot communicate. 
      METHODS: We reviewed the medical and imaging records of 45 patients who met the 
      inclusion criteria of the study, which included a diagnosis of spastic quadriplegic 
      cerebral palsy with severe motor and cognitive impairment, persistent pain of more 
      than 1 week in duration with no recognizable source, and a 3-phase whole-body bone 
      scan as part of the pain workup. RESULTS: The study group included 26 females and 19 
      males with an average age at presentation of 13.5 years (range, 3-20 years). A 
      positive bone scan was seen in 24 patients (53%). The diagnosis and the source of 
      pain were identified in all 24 patients with a positive bone scan, with the bone 
      scan being instrumental in establishing a diagnosis or localization in 22 patients. 
      An orthopaedic diagnosis was not established in the 21 other patients with a 
      negative bone scan. Based on the bone scan results, additional imaging was obtained 
      at the anatomical location indicated. The bone scan was used to establish a 
      diagnosis of fracture in 10 of 24 patients. Other diagnoses included 3 patients with 
      painful internal hardware, 2 with sinusitis, 2 with infections, and 1 with an 
      obstructed kidney. CONCLUSIONS: Whole-body bone scan is a viable imaging option to 
      identify the source of persistent pain in children who are noncommunicative. The 
      bone scan can assist in localizing the source of pain and direct the location for 
      further imaging as needed.

TI  - Screening for distress in patients with brain cancer using the NCCN's rapid 
      screening measure.
PG  - 621-5
AB  - GOALS OF WORK: Patients with brain cancer are at a risk of experiencing elevated 
      levels of distress due to the severe functional, neurocognitive, and 
      neuropsychological sequelae of the disease. Using the National Comprehensive Cancer 
      Network's Distress Thermometer, we evaluated the extent and sources of distress 
      within a population of patients with brain cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Participants were asked to complete the Distress Thermometer, a single-item rapid 
      screening tool for distress. The Distress Thermometer is a visual analog scale on 
      which participants rate their level of distress from '0' (none) to '10' (extreme). 
      Participants were also asked to designate which items from a 34-item list constitute 
      sources of distress. MAIN RESULTS: Fifty-two percent of participants met the > or =4 
      cut-off score for distress. The scores were positively correlated with 
      patient-reported emotional sources of distress (r = 0.444, p < 0.001), physical 
      sources of stress (r = 0.231, p < 0.05), and total number of concerns (r = 0.368, p 
      < 0.001). On average, brain tumor patients reported 5.8 cancer-related items of 
      concern. CONCLUSION: Brain cancer patients are likely to experience distress at some 
      point during their disease trajectory. Patient-reported emotional sources of 
      distress should be targeted and interventions should be designed to address sources 
      of distress such as worry, sadness, and depression.

TI  - Development and initial psychometric evaluation of the sport interference checklist.
PG  - 937-57
AB  - The Sport Interference Checklist (SIC) was developed in 141 athletes to assist in 
      the concurrent assessment of cognitive and behavioral problems experienced by 
      athletes in both training (Problems in Sports Training Scale, PSTS) and competition 
      (Problems in Sports Competition Scale, PSCS). An additional scale (Desire for Sport 
      Psychology Scale, DSPS) was developed to assess the degree to which athletes desire 
      sport psychology assistance in areas that are determined to be problematic. Factor 
      analysis of PSCS items reveals six factors (Dysfunctional Thoughts and Stress, 
      Academic and Adjustment Problems, Injury Concerns, Lack of Motivation, Overly 
      Confident/Critical, Pain Intolerance), accounting for 64% of the total variance. 
      PSTS and DSPS items yield four factors (Dysfunctional Thoughts and Stress, Academic 
      Problems, Injury Concerns, Poor Team Relationships), accounting for 59% and 63% of 
      total variance, respectively. Scores from these scales demonstrate acceptable 
      internal consistency and convergent and discriminative validity. Response patterns 
      of SIC scales are not influenced by gender or athlete type.

TI  - Confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit (CAM-ICU): translation, 
      retranslation and validation into Swedish intensive care settings.
PG  - 888-92
AB  - BACKGROUND: Becoming critical ill or severely injured leads to a process of worry, 
      anxiety and pain. Patients in intensive care sometimes have strange and frightening 
      experiences and may show symptoms of acute confusion or delirium. CAM-ICU, the 
      confusion assessment method for the intensive care unit, was based on the DSM IV, 
      the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders IV, and today, healthcare 
      professionals and researchers are increasingly accepting this concept of diagnosing 
      ICU delirium. In Sweden, there is no commonly used, single instrument or method to 
      test the development of ICU delirium. The aim of this study was to translate, 
      retranslate and validate CAM-ICU for use in Swedish ICU settings. METHODS: The 
      translation of the instrument was done according to the guidelines suggested by The 
      Translation and Cultural Adaptation group which includes preparation, forward 
      translation/reconciliation, back translation, back translation review, 
      harmonization, cognitive debriefing and validation. In the validation process, the 
      applicability of the Swedish version of the instruments was tested in a Swedish 
      intensive care unit. RESULTS: Fourteen adult patients were included in the study, 40 
      paired tests were carried out, and 80 CAM-ICU instruments were completed. The 
      participating patients were given CAM-ICU ratings using independent paired 
      evaluations by two nurses, specialized in intensive care, at least twice during the 
      patients' stay in the ICU. Interrater reliability was calculated using kappa 
      statistics. In the 40 paired observations, interrater reliability was 'very good' 
      (kappa statistics > 0.81). In our material, we recognized a delirium rate of 48%, 
      which is in accordance with previous studies. CONCLUSION: The translation of the 
      instrument CAM-ICU showed good correlation with the original version and could 
      therefore be applicable in a Swedish ICU setting. In the 40 paired observations, 
      interrater reliability was very good. Although there are limitations in using 
      CAM-ICU, previous studies reveal a need for a homogeneous screening instrument 
      making it possible to detect and determine ICU delirium; and from this basis are 
      able to implement and make the necessary decisions required in medical and nursing 
      care practice preventing ICU delirium.

TI  - Fear of falling in new long-term care enrollees.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To measure the prevalence of fear of falling in older adults at the time 
      of long- term care (LTC) enrollment and identify potentially treatable risk factors 
      for low fall related self-efficacy. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Three 
      LTC programs in Upstate New York. PARTICIPANTS: 112 new enrollees in LTC, aged 55 or 
      older, who passed a cognitive screen. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported falls, the falls 
      efficacy scale (FES), medical conditions, the short geriatric depression scale, and 
      physical performance measures (Berg balance scale, hip flexor, knee extensor and 
      grip strength, gait speed and a six-minute walk). RESULTS: Of the 54 subjects 
      (48.2%) who reported fear of falling, 41 (75.9%) reported activity modification 
      secondary to fear. Fearful subjects were more likely to be female (P = .003), report 
      low back pain (P = .030) and lower extremity arthritis (P = .037). Fearful subjects 
      were weaker at the hip (P < .001) and knee (P = .001), and had shorter six-minute 
      walk distances. Subjects with better FES scores had better Berg scores (P < .001), 
      had greater hip and knee strength, had faster gait speeds and walked further in six 
      minutes (P < .001, P = .006, P = .001 and P = .001 respectively). Subjects with low 
      FES scores and fearful subjects were more likely to have depressive symptoms (P = 
      .003, P = .044, respectively). CONCLUSION: Falls and fear of falling are more common 
      in new LTC enrollees than in previously described community dwelling and SNF 
      cohorts. Attention to associated characteristics like depression, arthritis, low 
      back pain and lower extremity weakness may identify opportunities to reduce fear and 
      improve patient safety during this transitional period.

      age. Impairments in mobility, falls and fear of falling are, therefore, of 
      prognostic value. Falls generally result from an interaction of multiple risk 
      factors. However, older people are often not aware of the risks of falling. They 
      neither recognize risk factors nor report these factors to their physicians. The aim 
      of this study was to develop and to test a self-reported multidimensional screening 
      instrument to evaluate risk factors of falling in community-dwelling older people. 
      Therefore, we identified multiple risk factors of falls based on a systematic 
      literature review and then developed a new questionnaire - the Senior Citizen Risk 
      of Falling Check. Risk factors, i.e. cognitive disorders, that are closely 
      associated with the demand of nursing care were not covered in this relatively 
      healthy target group. We pretested this instrument and adapted it before its use in 
      a pilot test in residents of a sheltered housing complex in Hamburg. A group of 117 
      residents (average age 82.9 years, range 68.2-98.2 years, 83.8% women), all without 
      care needs (assessed by the German health and care insurance system) returned the 
      Senior Citizen Risk of Falling Check. Within 2 weeks all 117 participants were 
      interviewed by telephone to analyze the test-retest reliability of the instrument 
      (Cohen's kappa). We administered 13 questions on visual and hearing deficits, 
      neurological impairment, depressive mood, medication use, muscle weakness, gait and 
      balance deficits, nutrition, and history of falls. On average, 6 risk factors were 
      reported (range 0-12). Reductions in gait speed (64.1%) was most frequently 
      mentioned. Of the participants, 30.8% fell at least once during the last year and 
      22.2% of these falls resulted in injuries (fractures, hematomas, laceration, pain). 
      Cohen's kappa was good (2/13 questions) to excellent (10/13 questions) with one 
      exception (balance question kappa=0.20). The study results confirm good test-retest 
      reliability of the fall risk screening Senior Citizen Risk of Falling Check. At the 
      moment we are working on the validation of this questionnaire to provide it to 
      senior citizens throughout Hamburg in cooperation with the City of Hamburg.

TI  - Thoracolumbar fracture in blunt trauma: is clinical exam enough for awake patients?
PG  - 168-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical examination is widely used to screen trauma patients for 
      thoracolumbar fracture (TLFx). Retrospective data suggests that patients with 
      altered sensorium may not manifest symptoms after TLFx. This study was designed to 
      prospectively test the sensitivity of physical examination for detection of TLFx in 
      patients with altered mentation. METHODS: Prospective data collection in a large 
      urban Level I trauma center from April 2002 to December 2003. During the study 
      period, thoracolumbar radiography was performed on patients with signs or symptoms 
      of TLFx, and also on patients with significant blunt trauma and any alteration in 
      mentation, including drowsiness or apparent intoxication. All patients were 
      classified as reliable if Glasgow coma score was >13 and the treating physician 
      judged them capable of accurately reporting pain, and those who did not met both 
      these conditions were deemed unreliable. Patients with normal mentation and no signs 
      or symptoms were excluded. Injuries, mental status, symptoms, physical examination, 
      and X-ray film results were recorded. RESULTS: There were 3,028 blunt trauma 
      patients evaluated during the study period. Thoracolumbar radiography was performed 
      on 537 patients. Of these, 442 patients were deemed reliable, and 166 had no signs 
      or symptoms of TLFx. Of these asymptomatic patients, 10 were found to have TLFx. Of 
      these 10 reliable patients with TLFx despite negative examination, none required 
      surgery, but four required a brace. CONCLUSIONS: Thoracolumbar fractures are often 
      clinically silent in blunt trauma patients with altered sensorium, even when they 
      appear able to reliably report pain. X-ray screening of these patients is 
      appropriate to prevent missed injury.

TI  - Validating the use of two-item measures of pain beliefs and coping strategies for a 
      veteran population.
PG  - 252-60
AB  - Previous research has demonstrated that 2-item versions of subscales from the 
      Chronic Pain Coping Inventory, Coping Strategy Questionnaire, and the Survey of Pain 
      Attitudes appear adequately reliable and valid for use in studies with large sample 
      sizes. It was suggested that use of the abbreviated scales might help to expand the 
      testing and application of cognitive-behavioral models of pain to new settings and 
      with new populations where assessment burden might be a key issue. This study 
      explored the utility of these brief scales among veterans in a Veterans Affairs 
      setting. Strong associations were found between the 2-item versions and their 
      respective parent scales. In addition, the 2-item scales were found to be associated 
      with other pain-related measures, supporting their predictive validity. The results 
      of this study replicate previous findings and offer support for the use of the 
      2-item versions for both screening and research purposes in Veterans Affairs 
      settings with a veteran population. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents the 
      psychometric properties of brief versions of 3 commonly used pain coping and belief 
      questionnaires in a unique population. These measures could be used clinically for 
      initial screening purposes, as well as for treatment monitoring.

TI  - Prevalence and intensity of pain after stroke: a population based study focusing on 
      patients' perspectives.
PG  - 590-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence and intensity of pain after stroke, focusing on 
      patients' perspectives. METHODS: During a one year period, 416 first-ever stroke 
      patients were included in the population based Lund Stroke Register. After 4 and 16 
      months (median), 297 patients (98% of survivors) were followed up. Worst pain 
      intensity during the previous 48 hours was assessed on a visual analogue scale 
      (VAS), range 0 to 100: a score of 0 to 30 was defined as no or mild pain; 40 to 100 
      as moderate to severe pain. NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) score and HbA1c were assessed 
      at baseline. At 16 months, screening for depression was done using the geriatric 
      depression scale (GDS-20), and cognition with the mini-mental state examination 
      (MMSE). Predictors of pain were determined by multivariate analyses. RESULTS: 
      Moderate to severe pain was reported by 96 patients (32%) after four months (VAS 
      median=60). Predictors of pain were younger age (p=0.01), female sex (p=0.006), 
      higher NIHSS score (p<0.001), and raised HbA1c (p=0.001) at stroke onset. At 16 
      months, only 62 patients (21%) had moderate to severe pain, but pain intensity was 
      more severe (median VAS score=70; p<0.016). Higher pain intensity correlated with 
      female sex, worse GDS-20 score, better MMSE score, and raised HbA1c. Pain was 
      persistent in 47%, disturbed sleep in 58%, and required rest for relief in 40% of 
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although prevalence of pain after stroke decreased with time, 
      after 16 months 21% had moderate to severe pain. Late pain after stroke was on 
      average more severe, and profoundly affected the patients' wellbeing.

TI  - Involuntary orientation of attention to unattended deviant nociceptive stimuli is 
      modulated by concomitant visual task difficulty. Evidence from laser evoked 
      potentials.
PG  - 2165-74
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent laser evoked potential (LEP) studies showed that unattended rare 
      intensity-deviant nociceptive stimuli enhance the LEP vertex positivity P2 ('P400 
      effect'). It was hypothesized to reflect an involuntary switch of attention to 
      nociceptive events. If true the P400 effect (1) should be produced when attention is 
      focused on a task in another sensory modality (primary task), and (2) should be 
      modulated by the primary task difficulty. METHODS: Subjects had to count the number 
      of visual symbols presented on a screen. In a difficult condition, symbols were 
      digits 1-4 (interference between amount and meaning). In an easy condition, symbols 
      were letters X (no interference). Nociceptive CO2 laser stimuli were simultaneously 
      delivered on the left hand. Occasional stronger deviant stimuli (16%) were presented 
      at random. In additional sessions, the strong stimuli were presented alone in 
      homogenous series (100%). RESULTS: LEP amplitude at about 400 ms was larger for rare 
      deviant than for homogenous stimuli. Visual task difficulty decreased LEP amplitude 
      at this latency. Deviant stimuli seemed also to interfere with performance in the 
      visual task. CONCLUSIONS: The results give evidence for considering the P400 effect 
      as reflecting an involuntary attentional shift to nociceptive events. SIGNIFICANCE: 
      The study provides electrophysiological evidences for an intrusive capacity of pain 
      to attract attention and to decrease behavioural performance in concurrent 
      processes. In turn, such an attentional shift is tampered if attention is very 
      engaged in a concomitant task.

      impairment].
PG  - 87-93
AB  - The objective of this study was to verify if the provision of care aimed at reducing 
      pain was identical between elderly people suffering from a server cognitive 
      distortion and other elderly people. The sample, taken from a two-tiered survey, was 
      composed of 352 elderly people living in 34 retirement homes or other similar 
      establishments housing the elderly. We categorised the residents into 2 groups: 
      Group I was comprised of those who had a complete loss of physical autonomy, and 
      Group II contained all of the others. Within these two groups, we compared four 
      types of medicine of which the prescription was given at the request of the patient 
      following a complaint, and four types of medicine prescribed as a result of the 
      analysis of biological tests and screening and not as a result of a complaint from 
      the patient. The results showed that the elderly people having a severe cognitive 
      impairment received significantly less medication aimed at reducing pain than the 
      other elderly people. This difference is not recognised when the medication is 
      prescribed as a result of a need noted due to a biological check-up and analysis.

TI  - [Disorders of neurocognitive function after coronary artery bypass grafting].
PG  - 66-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Neurocognitive dysfunction still remains a frequent problem after heart 
      surgery, complicating early recovery and strongly affecting postoperative quality of 
      life. The aim of our study was to determine incidence of cognitive dysfunction after 
      coronary artery bypass grafting for patients of low risk group and to find operative 
      and postoperative factors associated with early cognitive impairment. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Using exclusion criteria, which are known as risk factors for postoperative 
      neurological complications we selected a group of 30 coronary artery bypass grafting 
      patients. The day before surgery and 7 to 8 days after operation we evaluated 
      cognitive function of each patient using MMSE and standardized test battery of five 
      neuropsychological tests. The incidence of cognitive decline was evaluated using 
      composite z scores and 1 SD criteria. Preoperative ultrasound screening of 
      asymptomatic carotid artery was performed for each patient. RESULTS: Early 
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction was present in 13 (46.3%) of patients. Patients 
      with cognitive decline more often had asymptomic, hemodynamicly significant carotid 
      artery stenosis. Duration of operation and coronary artery bypass time was longer in 
      cognitive dysfunction group. As well there were more grafts performed to this group 
      of patients. We noticed a relationship between lower temperature during coronary 
      artery bypass and cognitive impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Incidence of cognitive 
      dysfunction for patients of low risk group was 46.3%. Cognitive decline was 
      associated with prolonged coronary artery bypass, operation time and number of 
      grafts.

TI  - Oral hygiene care for adults with dementia in residential aged care facilities.
PG  - 1-89
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to report on the best 
      available evidence relating to oral hygiene for adults with dementia in residential 
      aged care facilities, including: INCLUSION CRITERIA: This review considered any 
      randomised or non-randomised controlled studies, cohort studies, case-control 
      studies, multiple time series studies, uncontrolled studies, descriptive studies and 
      opinions of respected authorities (including theses and other publications) related 
      to residents with dementia living in residential aged care facilities in Australia 
      and overseas; community-dwelling adults with dementia; and special needs adult 
      populations (for preventive oral hygiene care strategies and interventions).The 
      review considered studies and publications designed to:1 quantify the oral health 
      status of older adults living in residential aged care facilities;2 quantify the 
      oral health status of adults with dementia living in the community and in 
      residential aged care facilities;3 evaluate tools used to assess the oral health of 
      residents by staff and carers working in residential aged care facilities;4 evaluate 
      preventive oral hygiene care strategies and interventions used in special needs 
      adult populations (including adults with dementia); and5 evaluate oral health care 
      training and oral hygiene care provision, staff and carers working in residential 
      aged care facilities.Dental outcome measures of interest were those relating to the 
      prevalence, incidence, experiences and increments of oral diseases and conditions 
      including: denture problems, coronal and root caries, periodontal diseases (plaque 
      accumulation, gingivitis, loss-of-attachment), oral mucosal conditions, xerostomia 
      and salivary gland hypofunction, tooth loss, difficulty chewing, behavioural 
      problems and pain/discomfort. Related characteristics and outcomes of interest 
      included: medical conditions, medications, cognitive status, functional status, 
      nutritional status and sociodemographics. SEARCH STRATEGY: The aim of the search was 
      to locate relevant English-language studies and publications appearing between 1980 
      and 2002. The search utilised a two-step approach, involving an initial search of 
      electronic databases using combinations of key words followed by a second extensive 
      search carried out using the identified key words. This was supplemented with a 
      secondary search of the references cited in the identified studies. Electronic 
      database searched were: Cinahl, Embase, Psycinfo, Medline and Current Contents. 
      METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: All selected studies were critically appraised by two 
      reviewers prior to inclusion in the review. RESULTS: In regards to relevance, 
      incidence, experiences, and increments of oral diseases and conditions, possible 
      risk factors identified included: saliva dysfunction, polypharmacy, comorbid medical 
      conditions, swallowing and dietary problems, increased functional dependence, need 
      for assistance with oral hygiene care, and poor access and utilisation of dental 
      care.Evidence on the use of assessment tools by carers to evaluate residents' oral 
      health showed that successful assessment of residents with and without dementia by 
      nursing staff requires appropriate staff training by a dental professional. Coupled 
      with appropriate training, an oral assessment screening tool designed for residents 
      with dementia has been successfully used by nursing and care staff to identify 
      residents requiring further review by dental professionals. Expert opinion in the 
      field indicates that oral assessment screenings by a staff member and then by a 
      dentist would ideally be undertaken upon admission to a facility, and regularly 
      thereafter by staff and/or dentists as required.Clinicians and researchers suggested 
      that oral hygiene care strategies to prevent oral diseases and conditions were found 
      to be effective in preventing oral diseases, and thus are relevant for use in the 
      resident with dementia.In regards to the provision of dental treatment and ongoing 
      management of oral diseases and conditions, the use of adjunctive and preventive 
      aids were found to be effective when introduced in conjunction with a staff training 
      program:Expert opinion suggests that behaviour management techniques will increase 
      the potential of performing oral hygiene care interventions. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      review suggests that the training of staff in the form of a comprehensive 
      practically oriented program addressing areas such as oral diseases, oral screening 
      assessment, and hands-on demonstration of oral hygiene techniques and products is 
      likely to have a positive impact on the management of oral hygiene care within 
      residential aged care facilities. The review also identified that regular brushing 
      with fluoride toothpaste, use of therapeutic fluoride products and application of 
      therapeutic chlorhexidine gluconate products are validated by research as effective 
      for the general population and some populations with special needs.

TI  - Disability in an urban black community in Zimbabwe.
PG  - 851-9
AB  - PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to establish which health conditions are 
      primarily responsible for disability and morbidity in a high-density area in Harare, 
      Zimbabwe. METHOD: House-to-house screening visits were followed up by medical 
      examination and interview of those identified as having a functional limitation. 
      RESULTS: Information was obtained during screening on 10,839 residents. Of these, 
      608 were examined by medical professionals. The rate of disability/morbidity was 
      5.6% for the whole sample. Headaches and migraine were the most common problem. 
      These were followed by back pain, hypertension and osteoarthritis. HIV/AIDS was the 
      fifth most common condition. Depression, based on responses to a screening tool, was 
      evident in one-third of the subjects. Common activity limitations included 
      difficulty with the performance of housework activities and with walking. HIV/AIDS 
      resulted in the most severe activity limitation, in that cognitive functions were 
      also affected. CONCLUSION: The middle-aged and elderly with osteoarthritis and young 
      women with depression constitute vulnerable groups who are not in a position to 
      demand services. The older women particularly need assistance as they are bearing 
      the double burden of their own degenerative conditions and the results of the 
      HIV/AIDS pandemic.

TI  - [A structured pain interview for geriatric patients].
PG  - 164-71
AB  - BACKGROUND: In old age, assessment of pain often is hampered by sensory and 
      cognitive deficits that do not allow the patients to fill in standardized 
      questionnaires without help from significant others. Therefore, as an alternative, 
      we developed a structured pain interview, and examined its properties and acceptance 
      in a sample of geriatric patients with pain. METHODS: The interview covers site of 
      pain, intensity of pain, its duration and persistency, pain related disability and, 
      finally, emotional and cognitive variables. In addition, the interviewer addresses 
      significant others to get information about medication, previous treatment, and 
      residence, and administers the Mini-Mental-State-Examination (MMSE). The analysis 
      includes 128 patients of pain centers older than 74 years, of whom 80% are female. 
      RESULTS: Forty percent of the subjects score below the critical MMSE value < or =23 
      indicative of cognitive impairment. These patients are responsible for 36 out of a 
      total of 39 missing values. A significant increase of missing values is observed in 
      patients with a MMSE score below 10. Cognitive impairment goes along with greater 
      functional and social disability. On the other hand, cognitive impairment is 
      unrelated to localization, intensity, and duration of pain. The memory item of the 
      MMSE can be used as a screening tool for cognitive impairment. Patients, who are 
      unable to recall any of the three objects, comprise 80% of the total of missing 
      values and demonstrate a low MMSE score. CONCLUSION: As long as geriatric patients 
      are able to communicate verbally, they are most likely to profit from the structured 
      pain interview in spite of existing cognitive impairment. A MMSE score <10 indicates 
      that the interpretation of the data obtained may be difficult, especially due to a 
      high frequency of missing values.

TI  - Screening mammography for frail older women: what are the burdens?
PG  - 779-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The potential benefits and harms of screening mammography in frail older 
      women are unknown. Therefore, we studied the outcomes of a screening mammography 
      policy that was instituted in a population of community-living nursing home-eligible 
      women as a result of requirements of state auditors. We focused on the potential 
      burdens that may be experienced. METHODS: Between January 1995 and December 1997, we 
      identified 216 consecutive women who underwent screening mammography after enrolling 
      in a program designed to provide comprehensive care to nursing home-eligible 
      patients who wished to stay at home. Mammograms were performed at 4 radiology 
      centers. From computerized medical records, we tracked each woman through September 
      1999 for performance and results of mammography, additional breast imaging and 
      biopsies, documentation of psychological reactions to screening, as well as vital 
      status. Mean follow-up was 2.6 years. RESULTS: The mean age of the 216 women was 81 
      years. Sixty-three percent were Asian, 91% were dependent in at least 1 activity of 
      daily living, 49% had cognitive impairment, and 11% died within 2 years. 
      Thirty-eight women (18%) had abnormal mammograms requiring further work-up. Of these 
      women, 6 refused work-up, 28 were found to have false-positive mammograms after 
      further evaluation, 1 was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and 3 were 
      diagnosed with local breast cancer. The woman diagnosed with DCIS and 1 woman 
      diagnosed with breast cancer were classified as not having benefited, because 
      screening identified clinically insignificant disease that would not have caused 
      symptoms in the women's lifetimes, since these women died of unrelated causes within 
      2 years of diagnosis. Therefore, 36 women (17%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 12 to 
      22) experienced burden from screening mammography (28 underwent work-up for 
      false-positive mammograms, 6 refused further work-up of an abnormal mammogram, and 2 
      had clinically insignificant cancers identified and treated). Forty-two percent of 
      these women had chart-documented pain or psychological distress as a result of 
      screening. Two women (0.9%; 95% CI, 0 to 2) may have received benefit from screening 
      mammography. CONCLUSION: We conclude that screening mammography in frail older women 
      frequently necessitates work-up that does not result in benefit, raising questions 
      about policies that use the rate of screening mammograms as an indicator of the 
      quality of care in this population. Encouraging individualized decisions may be more 
      appropriate and may allow screening to be targeted to older women for whom the 
      potential benefit outweighs the potential burdens.

TI  - [Disease specific stress of tumor patients at the beginning of radiotherapy. Effects 
      on psychosocial support requirement].
PG  - 530-7
AB  - PURPOSE: Radiotherapy brings a tumor patient into a special life situation in which 
      different variables play a role of often unknown importance. The goal of this study 
      was to investigate disease specific stress of tumor patients at the beginning of 
      radiotherapy with established psychodiagnostic questionnaires and to evaluate the 
      effect on psychosocial support requirement in order to reduce stress and to improve 
      quality of life and compliance during radiotherapeutical treatment. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: 732 patients were screened, of whom 446 (60.9%) fulfilled the criteria for 
      inclusion (refusals 21.0%, low karnorsky performance status 6.6%, management 
      problems 3.4%, language barriers 3.0%, cognitive restrictions 2.6%, death 2.5%). 
      Disease specific aspects of stress in the questionnaire (Fragebogen zur Belastung 
      von Krebspatienten, FBK), life situation (LS) and self-defined care requirements 
      (BB) (Figure 1) were self-rated by patients with different tumor types before 
      radiotherapy. Medical and sociodemographic data were also documented. We 
      investigated 446 patients (262 male, 184 female; median age 60.0 years) with 
      different diagnoses (Table 1). RESULTS: Stress was observed mainly due to reduction 
      of efficiency, anxiety and pain on the subscales (Figure 2). Women had a significant 
      higher stress on subscales of pain (p = 0.016) and anxiety (p = 0.009) (Table 2), 
      patients younger than 45 years in the subscale information (p = 0.002) and patients 
      older than 45 and younger than 60 years in the subscale anxiety (p = 0.002) and the 
      total score (p = 0.003) (Table 3). Patients with mamma carcinoma had the highest the 
      stress (Table 4). The maximum percentages of patients under high stress were found 
      for the subscales of efficiency (43%) and anxiety (40%). The support requirement was 
      characterized by the need of more medical information and dialogue with the doctor. 
      We saw a significant correlation of high stress and high care requirement (Tables 5 
      and 6). CONCLUSIONS: Psychosocial support should be founded on psychosocial stress 
      diagnostic and self-defined care requirement.

TI  - A nurse-led interdisciplinary intervention program for delirium in elderly 
      hip-fracture patients.
PG  - 523-32
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To develop and test the effect of a nurse-led interdisciplinary 
      intervention program for delirium on the incidence and course (severity and 
      duration) of delirium, cognitive functioning, functional rehabilitation, mortality, 
      and length of stay in older hip-fracture patients. DESIGN: Longitudinal prospective 
      before/after design (sequential design). SETTING: The emergency room and two 
      traumatological units of an academic medical center located in an urban area in 
      Belgium. PARTICIPANTS: 60 patients in an intervention cohort (81.7% females, median 
      age = 82, interquartile range (IQR) = 13) and another 60 patients in a usual 
      care/nonintervention cohort (80% females, median age = 80, IQR = 12). INTERVENTION: 
      (1) Education of nursing staff, (2) systematic cognitive screening, (3) consultative 
      services by a delirium resource nurse, a geriatric nurse specialist, or a 
      psychogeriatrician, and (4) use of a scheduled pain protocol. MEASUREMENTS: All 
      patients were monitored for signs of delirium, as measured by the Confusion 
      Assessment Method (CAM). Severity of delirium was assessed using a variant of the 
      CAM. Cognitive and functional status were measured by the Mini-Mental State 
      Examination (MMSE) (including subscales of memory, linguistic ability, 
      concentration, and psychomotor executive skills) and the Katz Index of activities of 
      daily living (ADLs), respectively. RESULTS: Although there was no significant effect 
      on the incidence of delirium (23.3% in the control vs 20.0% in the intervention 
      cohort; P =.82), duration of delirium was shorter (P =.03) and severity of delirium 
      was less (P =.0049) in the intervention cohort. Further, clinically higher cognitive 
      functioning was observed for the delirious patients in the intervention cohort 
      compared with the nonintervention cohort. Additionally, a trend toward decreased 
      length of stay postoperatively was noted for the delirious patients in the 
      intervention cohort. Despite these positive intervention effects, no effect on ADL 
      rehabilitation was found. Results for risk of mortality were inconclusive. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the beneficial effects of an intervention 
      program focusing on early recognition and treatment of delirium in older 
      hip-fracture patients and confirms the reversibility of the syndrome in view of the 
      delirium's duration and severity.

TI  - Comparing cognitive and screening tests for neurotoxicity. Effects of acute 
      chlorpyrifos on visual signal detection and a neurobehavioral test battery in rats.
PG  - 33-44
AB  - It is often assumed that cognitive function is more sensitive to neurotoxic 
      chemicals than are the unconditioned behaviors employed in neurobehavioral screens; 
      however, direct comparisons of the sensitivity of these test methods are lacking. 
      The present studies were conducted to compare the effects of the widely used 
      cholinesterase-inhibiting insecticide, chlorpyrifos (O,O'-diethyl 
      O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphorothionate, CPF), on a visual signal detection 
      task (SDT) with its effects on a neurobehavioral test battery. Adult male Long-Evans 
      rats were trained to perform the SDT, dosed with CPF, and then assessed with both 
      test instruments. Oral CPF (50 mg/kg) impaired signal detection for 8 days, and 
      subcutaneous CPF (250 mg/kg) did so for 4 weeks. CPF (30 and 50 mg/kg po and 250 
      mg/kg sc) also lowered activity in the test battery for up to 18 days. Thus, CPF 
      impaired attention and altered behavior in the test battery in the same dose ranges 
      under two very different dosing scenarios.

TI  - NCCN Practice Guidelines for Cancer-Related Fatigue.
PG  - 151-61
AB  - These guidelines propose a treatment algorithm in which patients are evaluated 
      regularly for fatigue, using a brief screening instrument, and are treated as 
      indicated by their fatigue level. The algorithm's goal is to identify and treat all 
      patients with fatigue that causes distress or interferes with daily activities or 
      functioning. Management of fatigue begins with primary oncology team members who 
      perform the initial screening and either provide basic education and counseling or 
      expand the initial screening to a more focused evaluation for moderate or higher 
      levels of fatigue. At this point the patient is assessed for the five primary 
      factors known to be associated with fatigue: pain, emotional distress, sleep 
      disturbance, anemia, and hypothyroidism. If any of these conditions are present, it 
      should be treated according to practice guidelines, and the patient's fatigue should 
      be reevaluated regularly. If none of the primary factors is present or the fatigue 
      is unresolved, a more comprehensive assessment is indicated--with referral to other 
      care providers as appropriate. The comprehensive assessment should include a 
      thorough review of systems, review of medications, assessment of comorbidities, 
      nutritional/metabolic evaluation, and assessment of activity level. Management of 
      fatigue is cause-specific when conditions known to cause fatigue can be identified 
      and treated. When specific causes, such as infection, fluid and electrolyte 
      imbalances, or cardiac dysfunction, cannot be identified and corrected, 
      nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment of the fatigue should be considered. 
      Nonpharmacologic interventions may include a moderate exercise program to improve 
      functional capacity and activity tolerance, restorative therapies to decrease 
      cognitive alterations and improve mood state, and nutritional and sleep 
      interventions for patients with disturbances in eating or sleeping. Pharmacologic 
      therapy may include drugs such as antidepressants for depression or erythropoietin 
      for anemia. A few clinical reports of the use of corticosteroids and 
      psychostimulants suggest the need for further research on these agents as a 
      potential treatment modalities in managing fatigue. Basic to these interventions, 
      the effective management of cancer-related fatigue involves an informed and 
      supportive oncology care team that assesses patients' fatigue levels regularly and 
      systematically and incorporates education and counseling regarding strategies for 
      coping with fatigue (Johnson, 1999), as well as using institutional fatigue 
      management experts for referral of patients with unresolved fatigue.

      patients.
PG  - 261-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the validity of the Beck Depression Inventory short form 
      when used to screen for depression in chronic pain patients. SETTING: A 
      multidisciplinary pain management center located in a major university medical 
      center. PATIENTS: Seven hundred sixty-five persons presenting for evaluation of 
      chronic pain, including low back pain, head/neck pain, and extremity pain. MEASURES: 
      Beck Depression Inventory short form, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Pain Disability 
      Index, pain drawing, and Quality of Life Scale. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Items on 
      the Beck Depression Inventory short form reflecting pain-related interference with 
      function (i.e., disability) were endorsed to a greater degree than affective and 
      cognitive items. A factor analysis of the inventory yielded two affective/cognitive 
      factors and one "disability" factor (work inhibition and fatigue). The correlations 
      between the factor scores and the Pain Disability Index suggested that endorsement 
      of the work inhibition and fatigue items by chronic pain patients may not be 
      indicative of affective disturbance. The results suggest that these items should be 
      evaluated critically for their contribution to the total score of the Beck 
      Depression Inventory short form when assessing depression in chronic pain patients.

TI  - Psychopathology and pain in medical in-patients predict resource use during 
      hospitalization but not rehospitalization.
PG  - 585-92
AB  - The authors investigated the relationship between psychopathology and resource use 
      in general medical in-patients during hospitalization and rehospitalization. Between 
      1 July 1987, and 30 April 1989, 1020 in-patients were prospectively screened for 
      depression, anxiety, cognitive dysfunction, and pain. Overall, the screen identified 
      47% of patients as having high psychopathology or pain, including 25.7% depressed, 
      21.8% anxious, 17.6% with cognitive dysfunction, and 5.2% with high pain. There were 
      no measured differences in demographics or disease severity between high and low 
      psychopathology groups. High psychopathology patients had longer stays and higher 
      costs during the index hospitalization but there were no differences during 
      subsequent hospitalizations. Length of stay declined overall during the study 
      period, but there were no changes over time in the association between high 
      psychopathology or pain with increased resource use. The measured symptoms of 
      psychopathology and pain we measured are associated with increased short-term 
      utilization of health care resources, but the increase does not extend to subsequent 
      hospitalizations. Outcome studies aiming to reduce psychopathology in medical 
      in-patients should pay particular attention to short term costs.

TI  - Cognitive impairment in musculoskeletal pain patients.
PG  - 253-62
AB  - To assess the incidence and relationship of cognitive/intellectual impairments to 
      pain problems, seventy-three adults with musculoskeletal pain seen in a PM&R 
      outpatient clinic were screened using the Neurobehavioral Cognitive Status 
      Examination (NCSE). Subjective pain complaints were assessed using portions of the 
      McGill Pain Questionnaire. Patients with prior diagnoses of neurocognitive problems 
      or those who had taken narcotic analgesics in the last 24 hours were excluded. 
      Results showed that 32 percent of subjects had impaired performance in at least one 
      cognitive domain. Individuals with poorer performance on the NCSE had higher levels 
      of reported pain or disability and psychological distress. Possible factors 
      contributing to poor performance on cognitive tasks include psychological disorders 
      or distress, undiagnosed organic brain dysfunction, social/psychological factors 
      such as education, or a combination of these. Results suggest the need for further 
      research to understand the relationship of poor performance on cognitive tasks to 
      the etiology, maintenance and rehabilitation of pain problems.

TI  - Cognitive and physiological feedback on cold pain tolerance.
PG  - 539-41
AB  - Results supported the relevancy of cognitive information effects on pain tolerance, 
      in that subjects who were given a rational and accurate explanation of what to 
      expect showed greater tolerance than those who received irrelevant information. 
      Accurate monitoring of hand temperature did not seem necessarily advantagous as an 
      influence on pain tolerance. It appears merely watching a monitor, regardless of the 
      specific contents of the screen, resulted in longer hand immersion times when 
      compared to no monitor. The monitors seem to serve as distractors and specificity of 
      physiological information was not particularly useful. However, neither information 
      nor physiological monitoring emerged as the primary influence on pain tolerance in 
      this study. Instead, the strongest predictors found were motivation and 
      self-efficacy. The subject's own self prediction of anticipated performance with 
      cold induced pain was closely consistent with actual performance. Although these 
      results alone may not generalize to extended field situations, this study does 
      reinforce the general findings of previous research: namely Bandura's (10) evidence 
      on self-efficacy. While it is obvious cold temperatures have measurable 
      physiological consequences, the experience of pain is also psychologically mediated. 
      Pain associated with cold injury and frostbite in hospital studies show personality 
      correlates are significantly related to the frequency, severity and tragedy of 
      subsequent results (15). A replication of this study will include male subjects even 
      though it is anticipated that findings will be consistent, with perhaps longer 
      immersion times. Future research may want to develop training strategies aimed at 
      teaching self-efficacy and realistic expectations of potential consequences in cold 
      environments rather than scare tactics regarding physiological and psychological 
      cold pain tolerance.

TI  - The Functional Assessment Screening Questionnaire: application for evaluating 
      pain-related disability.
PG  - 303-7
AB  - The Functional Assessment Screening Questionnaire (FASQ) is a 15-item checklist 
      which was developed for primary care populations and may serve as a questionnaire 
      method for evaluating disability which is associated with chronic pain. One hundred 
      fifty-eight patients completed the FASQ as part of an initial multidisciplinary 
      evaluation of chronic pain. Reliability was reaffirmed through split-half and 
      alternate-form methods. Responses were examined to explore relationships to aspects 
      of disability. Although job functions were not directly assessed, the scores of 
      employed vs unemployed respondents differed significantly. Findings were related to 
      Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory scale scores but appeared to reflect a 
      separate phenomenon. Scale 1 (Hs) was the most useful scale for predicting level of 
      reported impairment. Nonparametric methods showed levels of functioning varying 
      significantly by site of pain complaint. Patients with back pain reported the most 
      difficulty; those with head pain and genital pain reported the least difficulty. An 
      internal structure appropriate to chronic pain populations was discerned, with two 
      general factors measuring either physical-motoric or cognitive-social aspects of 
      disability. Aside from constraints associated with the use of self-report methods, 
      the FASQ may be helpful as part of efforts to portray pain-related disability.

TI  - The continuing hazard of lead exposure and its effects in children.
PG  - 23-42
AB  - Recent epidemiological data have shown in U.S. children aged six months to five 
      years, that an estimated four percent, or approximately 675,000 children, have 
      increased lead absorption (i.e., blood lead concentration (PbB) greater than or 
      equal to 30 micrograms Pb/dl (microgram%) whole blood). The rate was highest among 
      low income, inner city black children, among whom 18.6% or approximately 159,000 
      show PbB greater than or equal to 30 micrograms%. There have been substantial 
      reductions in the use of lead in gasoline and in lead in food during the past four 
      years. Although the use of lead in residential paints was banned in the U.S. in 
      1977, a large stock of lead painted old housing remains in use today. Until this 
      substandard old housing is completely renovated or replaced, it will remain the 
      principle environmental lead hazard for young children. Regarding effects of lead in 
      the CNS, there is agreement on the following: 1) sustained PbB greater than or equal 
      to 60 micrograms% during the early preschool years substantially increases the risk 
      of later learning impairment in school, 2) sustained PbB greater than or equal to 40 
      micrograms% may increase the risk significantly but moderately, 3) the clinical 
      significance of sustained PbB during early childhood in the range of 25-40 
      micrograms% remains uncertain, and 4) prospective longitudinal studies are essential 
      to delineate the CNS effects of low level lead exposure. The primary screening test 
      for increased lead absorption is the free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP) micro 
      test. This test will detect 95% or more of children with PbB greater than or equal 
      to 50 micrograms%; however, less than 50% are detected by the FEP test when PbB = 
      30-50 micrograms%.

TI  - Painful truths about depressives' cognitions.
PG  - 848-53
AB  - Cognitive theories assert that depressed persons' cognitions are distorted. Most of 
      the empirical literature directly contradicts this assertion. Using a wide variety 
      of methods to study a wide variety of cognitive processes, experiments consistently 
      find that depressed people suffer significantly less cognitive distortion than do 
      both normals and nondepressed psychiatric patients. It was speculated that childhood 
      traumas predispose depression by preventing the normal formation of a defensive 
      screen against painful realities.

TI  - Cognitive changes during the menstrual cycle.
PG  - 339-46
AB  - A predominantly non-student group of sixty-five women volunteers, screened for 
      medication use, prospectively completed the Moos Menstrual Distress Questionnaire 
      (MDQ) and the Temporal Disorganization Scale (TDS) weekly for one month along with a 
      daily calendar of menstrual status. Data analysis revealed that TDS, concentration 
      disturbances, negative affect, pain and water retention were rated as higher 
      premenstrually and menstrually. Women dichotomized into groups based on high and low 
      premenstrual TDS scores demonstrated different symptom patterns across the menstrual 
      cycle. For the high premenstrual TDS group, concentration, behavioral change, 
      negative affect and pain were all rated highest premenstrually; for the low 
      premenstrual TDS and group the TDS score was rated highest menstrually. The 
      relevance of these findings to literature reports of associations between 
      psychopathology and menstrual cycle phase are discussed.

TI  - Factors Associated with Benzodiazepines Prolonged-Term Use in Post-Stroke Subjective 
      Sleep Disturbance: A Single-Centre Retrospective Study from China.
PG  - 2469-2481
LID - 10.2147/DDDT.S298552 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the prevalence of short- and long-term benzodiazepine and 
      z-drugs (BZD) for the treatment of post-stroke subjective sleep disturbance (SSD) 
      and to evaluate the risk factors associated with prolonged BZD treatment in this 
      patient body. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between 1st January 2018 and 1st December 2018, 
      we identified 542 inpatients suffering from acute stroke in Heyuan People's 
      Hospital. Of these, 290 inpatients were included in our final analysis. These 
      patients were divided into three groups according to the treatment they received: 
      non/occasional BZD (non-BZD), short-term BZD (short-term) and prolonged-term BZD 
      (prolonged-term) treatment. We investigated the prevalence of each BZD treatment 
      term and identified differences between the groups. Univariate logistic regression 
      analysis was used to identify potential predictors for the prolonged use of BZD. 
      Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to assess the correlation between 
      the prolonged use of BZD and potential predictors. RESULTS: The prevalence of cases 
      receiving short and prolonged BZD treatments were 40.35% and 31.72%, respectively; 
      none of the patients received polysomnography (PSG) screening from obstructive sleep 
      apnoea (OSP). Treatment strategies were limited to BZD and traditional Chinese 
      medicine; none of the patients received cognitive-behavioral treatment (CBT) or 
      other forms of treatment. Logistic regression analysis showed that the short-term 
      use was associated with z-drugs (odds ratio [OR]: 2.189, 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.419-3.378), non-communication barriers (OR =0.535, 95% CI: 0.325-0.880) and 
      posterior circulation infarct (POCI) (OR =2.199, 95% CI: 1.112-4.349). The 
      prolonged-term use was associated with z-drugs (OR =3.012, 95% CI: 1.637-5.542), 
      non-communication barriers (OR =0.530, 95% CI: 0.307-0.916), partial anterior 
      circulation infarct (PACI) (OR =0.455, 95% CI: 0.250-0.827), and non pain after 
      stroke (OR =0.315, 95% CI: 0.207-0.480). CONCLUSION: The status of BZD abuse for 
      post-stroke SSD is worrying. Additional research attention and treatment options are 
      needed for the treatment of post-stroke SSD. In particular, the potential 
      combination of stroke and OSP appears to be underestimated and neglected. 
      Post-stroke SSD patients should receive more comprehensive assessment and rigid 
      follow-up to avoid the prolonged use of BZD. Additional and effective therapeutic 
      strategies (such as positive pressure ventilation treatment or CBT) are urgently 
      needed for cause-specific intervention.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To support the research agenda in yoga for health by comprehensively 
      identifying systematic reviews of yoga for health outcomes and conducting a 
      bibliometric analysis to describe their publication characteristics and topic 
      coverage. METHODS: We searched 7 databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, 
      CINAHL, AMED, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and PROSPERO) from their 
      inception to November 2019 and 1 database (INDMED) from inception to January 2017. 
      Two authors independently screened each record for inclusion and one author 
      extracted publication characteristics and topics of included reviews. RESULTS: We 
      retrieved 2710 records and included 322 systematic reviews. 157 reviews were 
      exclusively on yoga, and 165 were on yoga as one of a larger class of interventions 
      (e.g., exercise). Most reviews were published in 2012 or later (260/322; 81 %). 
      First/corresponding authors were from 32 different countries; three-quarters were 
      from the USA, Germany, China, Australia, the UK or Canada (240/322; 75 %). Reviews 
      were most frequently published in speciality journals (161/322; 50 %) complementary 
      medicine journals (66/322; 20 %) or systematic review journals (59/322; 18 %). 
      Almost all were present in MEDLINE (296/322; 92 %). Reviews were most often funded 
      by government or non-profits (134/322; 42 %), unfunded (74/322; 23 %), or not 
      explicit about funding (111/322; 34 %). Common health topics were 
      psychiatric/cognitive (n = 56), cancer (n = 39) and musculoskeletal conditions (n = 
      36). Multiple reviews covered similar topics, particularly depression/anxiety (n = 
      18), breast cancer (n = 21), and low back pain (n = 16). CONCLUSIONS: Further 
      research should explore the overall quality of reporting and conduct of systematic 
      reviews of yoga, the direction and certainty of specific conclusions, and 
      duplication or gaps in review coverage of topics.

TI  - Ageing in general practice (AGP) trial: a cluster randomised trial to examine the 
      effectiveness of peer education on GP diagnostic assessment and management of 
      dementia.
PG  - 12
LID - 10.1186/1471-2296-13-12 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Dementia is increasing in prevalence as the population ages. An earlier 
      rather than later diagnosis allows persons with dementia and their families to plan 
      ahead and access appropriate management. However, most diagnoses are made by general 
      practitioners (GPs) later in the course of the disease and are associated with 
      management that is poorly adherent to recommended guidelines. This trial examines 
      the effectiveness of a peer led dementia educational intervention for GPs. METHODS: 
      The study is a cluster randomised trial, conducted across three states and five 
      sites. All GPs will complete an audit of their consenting patients aged 75 years or 
      more at three time points - baseline, 12 and 24 months. GPs allocated to the 
      intervention group will receive two educational sessions from a peer GP or nurse, 
      and will administer the GPCOG to consenting patients at baseline and 12 months. The 
      first education session will provide information about dementia and the second will 
      provide individualised feedback on audit results. GPs in the waitlist group will 
      receive the RACGP Guidelines by post following the 12 month audit OUTCOMES: Primary 
      outcomes are carer and consumer quality of life and depression. Secondary outcomes 
      include: rates of GP identification of dementia compared to a more detailed gold 
      standard assessment conducted in the patient's home; GP identification of 
      differential diagnoses including reversible causes of cognitive impairment; and GP 
      referral to specialists, Alzheimers' Australia and support services. A "case 
      finding" and a "screening" group will be compared and the psychometrics of the GPCOG 
      will be examined. SAMPLE SIZE: Approximately 2,000 subjects aged 75 years and over 
      will be recruited through approximately 160 GPs, to yield approximately 200 subjects 
      with dementia (reducing to 168 by 24 months). DISCUSSION: The trial outlined in this 
      paper has been peer reviewed and supported by the Australian National Health and 
      Medical Research Council. At the time of submission of this paper 2,034 subjects 
      have been recruited and the intervention delivered to 114 GPs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: 
      Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register (ANZCTR): ACTRN12607000117415.
