This type of tumor usually grows very slow. However, it can compress brain tissue. Publications about secondary Neuropsychological alterations to a diagnosis of meningioma are generally sparse, but there are studies that indicate cognitive deficit in attention, memory, executive functions and visuoconstructive skills. Objective(s): To identify Neuropsychological alterations in patients with diagnosis of frontoparietal meningioma. Participant(s): A 52-year-old female patient, married, right-handed and who is an artist. She shows a clinical picture of head trauma without loss of consciousness accompanied by a persistent headache. A radiograph of paranasal sinuses taken showed a normal result. The image of brain scan showed a 2.7 x 2.4 cm meningioma located in the left frontoparietal area with hyperostosis. Materials: A protocol of neuropsychological evaluation was applied with MMSE test, digit span test, TMT (A/B), Babcock story recall test, Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test, clock-drawing test, memory test, Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) and a verbal fluency task. Result(s): It was found that the patient had difficulty to handle immediate information associated with a possible dysfunction of the frontal lobe (working memory), inability to recall material given by auditory pathway (delayed verbal memory). It was found that the patient was unable to generate verbs or alternation of the same (Executive functions), affecting her quality of life to a lesser extent. Conclusion(s): The results indicate that the patient presents Neuropsychological alterations which are associated with frontal lobe. It is suggested to carry out plans of functional Neurorehabilitation which aim at the improvement of the quality of life of the patient, or future people with this type of diagnosis.Copyright © 2017, Scientific Publishers of India.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the effect of pre-emptive analgesia via a continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) on postoperative pain and early cognitive function following total knee arthroplasty (TKA) surgery in elderly patients. CFNB was performed prior to TKA surgery in the preemptive analgesia group (n=30) and following TKA surgery in the control group (n=30). POCD was defined as a two-point reduction in the postoperative score compared with the preoperative score in the mini-mental state examination. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used to evaluate the intensity of pain at rest and during exercise. The intraoperative dose of remifentanil in the pre-emptive analgesia group was significantly lower than in the control group (P<0.01). In the preemptive analgesia group, VAS scores at three days post-surgery were lower than those in the control group (P<0.01). The incidence of POCD on the third postoperative day was slightly lower in the pre-emptive analgesia group compared with the control group. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that pre-emptive analgesia by CFNB may promote the recovery of early cognitive function following TKA in elderly patients.Copyright © 2017, Spandidos Publications.

Method(s): This 52-week study consisted of 16-week randomized placebo-controlled (RCT) and 36-week open-label extension phases. Of 142 DLB patients enrolled in the RCT phase (three arms: placebo, 5 mg, and 10 mg), 110 entered the extension phase. The placebo group of the RCT phase initiated active treatment at week 16, and the active groups maintained allocated treatment and dosages until week 24. After week 24, all patients received 10 mg. Dose reduction to 5 mg for safety concerns was allowed. Efficacy measures included Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for cognitive function and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) for behavioral symptoms. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AEs) and the unified Parkinson disease rating scale. Result(s): In total, 100 subjects completed the study. Cognitive function improvement was sustained for 52 weeks (MMSE at week 52 in 10 mg: 2.8+/-3.5 (mean+/-standard deviation); P <0.001, Student paired t test)). Those who received placebo in the RCT phase showed an improvement after starting active treatment. NPI improved in all the groups throughout the study, including the placebo period. In the subgroup of the 5 mg group without remarkable cognitive or behavioral improvement at week 24, further improvement was observed after a dose increase to 10 mg. After week 24, 21 patients experienced dose reduction. The incidence of any AEs did not increase over time. Conclusion(s): The long-term administration of donepezil at 10 mg/day improved cognitive function for up to 52 weeks in patients with DLB without increasing the risk of clinically significant safety events.

Included were 34 patients with acute NPSLE with mean age of 33.26 +/- 10.14 years and duration of illness of 3.33 +/- 1.71 years. Clinical interviewing and psychiatric and cognitive evaluations were performed by applying the criteria of the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental health disorders criteria (DSM-IV), Stanford Binet Subset Testing, Mini-Mental State Examination and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised. Serologic tests included looking for antinuclear antibodies, anti-double strand DNA, anti-phospholipid antibodies. Radiologic evaluation included conventional MRI, DWI and MRA. One or more NP manifestations were diagnosed in 28 patients, in which cognitive deficits were reported with headache, psychosis and CVS. Anti-phospholipid antibodies were reported in patients with CVS. Twenty patients (71.43 %) with primary NPSLE (n = 28) had MRI abnormalities in which hyperintense signals at subcortical and periventricular white matter and at the junction between the gray and white matter represented 75 % (n = 15) and with headache (n = 6), psychosis (n = 6) and acute confusional state (n = 3) with and without cognitive deficits, respectively. Moderate-sized infarctions with restricted diffusion in the distribution of middle cerebral arteries were represented in 35 % (n = 7) and with CVS, of them, 71.43 % (n = 5) had beading and focal narrowing of carotid arteries were consistent with vasculitis. Brain atrophy represented 20 % (n = 4) and with psychosis. Compared to those with normal MRI, patients with MRI abnormalities were older (P < 0.050) and had longer duration of illness (P < 0.050). To conclude, although DWI and MRA are helping in more precise etiopathologic diagnosis compared to conventional MRI, but their relevance to the present NP manifestations is still limited. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Vertebral compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis is a cause of morbidity in older adults. VCFs can affect both genders, but are more common among elderly females and can occur as a result of a fall or a minor trauma. The fracture may occur spontaneously during a simple activity such as picking up an object or rising up from a chair. Pain originating from the fracture site frequently increases with weight bearing. It is most severe during the first few weeks and decreases with rest and inactivity. Traditional treatment of painful VCFs includes bed rest, analgesic use, back bracing and muscle relaxants. The comorbidities associated with VCFs include deep venous thrombosis, acceleration of osteopenea, loss of height, respiratory problems and emotional problems due to chronic pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that has gained popularity as a new treatment option in the care for these patients. The technique of vertebroplasty was initially developed in France to treat osteolytic metastasis, myeloma, and hemangioma. The indications were further expanded to painful osteoporotic VCFs and subsequently to treatment of asymptomatic VCFs. The mechanism of pain relief, which occurs within minutes to hours after vertebroplasty, is still not known. Pain pathways in the surrounding tissue appear to be altered in response to mechanical, chemical, vascular, and thermal stimuli after the injection of the cement. It has been suggested that mechanisms other than mechanical stabilization of the fracture, such as thermal injury to the nerve endings, results in immediate pain relief.; Percutaneous Vertebroplasty: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is performed with the patient in prone position and under local or general anesthesia. The procedure involves fluoroscopic imaging to guide the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body to support the fractured bone. After injection of the cement, the patient is placed in supine position for about 1 hour while the cement hardens. Cement leakage is the most frequent complication of vertebroplasty. The leakages may remain asymptomatic or cause symptoms of nerve irritation through compression of nerve roots. There are several reports of pulmonary cement embolism (PCE) following vertebroplasty. In some cases, the PCE may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic PCE can be recognized by their clinical signs and symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, coughing, hemoptysis, dizziness, and sweating.; Literature Search: A literature search was performed on Feb 9, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 2005 to February 9, 2010. Studies were initially reviewed by titles and abstracts. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained and reviewed. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. Data extraction was carried out by the author.; Study Design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vertebroplasty with a control group or other interventions; Study Population: Adult patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracturesSTUDY SAMPLE SIZE: Studies included 20 or more patientsEnglish language full-reportsPublished between Jan 1 2005 and Feb 9, 2010(eligible studies identified through the Auto Alert function of the search were also included); Exclusion Criteria: Non-randomized studiesStudies on conditions other than VCF (e.g. patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic tumors)Studies focused on surgical techniquesStudies lacking outcome measures RESULTS OF EVIDENCE-BASED ANALYSIS: A systematic search yielded 168 citations. The titles and the abstracts of the citations were reviewed and full text of the identified citations was retrieved for further consideration. Upon review of the full publications and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5 RCTs were identified. Of these, two compared vertebroplasty with sham procedure, two compared vertebroplasty with conservative treatment, and one compared vertebroplasty with balloon kyphoplasty.; Randomized Controlled Trials: Recently, the results of two blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials of percutaneous vertebroplasty were reported. These trials, providing the highest quality of evidence available to date, do not support the use of vertebroplasty in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Based on the results of these trials, vertebroplasty offer no additional benefit over usual care and is not risk free. In these trials the treatment allocation was blinded to the patients and outcome assessors. The control group received a sham procedure simulating vertebroplasty to minimize the effect of expectations and to reduce the potential for bias in self-reporting of outcomes. Both trials applied stringent exclusion criteria so that the results are generalizable to the patient populations that are candidates for vertebroplasty. In both trials vertebroplasty procedures were performed by highly skilled interventionists. Multiple valid outcome measures including pain, physical, mental, and social function were employed to test the between group differences in outcomes. Prior to these two trials, there were two open randomized trials in which vertebroplasty was compared with conservative medical treatment. In the first randomized trial, patients were allowed to cross over to the other arm and had to be stopped after two weeks due to the high numbers of patients crossing over. The other study did not allow cross over and recently published the results of 12 months follow-up. The following is the summary of the results of these 4 trials: Two blinded RCTs on vertebroplasty provide the highest level of evidence available to date. Results of these two trials are supported by findings of an open randomized trial with 12 months follow-up. Blinded RCTs showed: No significant differences in pain scores of patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure as measured at 3 days, 2 weeks and 1 month in one study and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the other.The observed differences in pain scores between the two groups were neither statistically significant nor clinically important at any time points.The above findings were consistent with the findings of an open RCT in which patients were followed for 12 months. This study showed that improvement in pain was similar between the two groups at 3 months and were sustained to 12 months.In the blinded RCTs, physical, mental, and social functioning were measured at the above time points using 4-5 of the following 7 instruments: RDQ, EQ-5D, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, AQoL, QUALEFFO, SOF-ADLThere were no significant differences in any of these measures between patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure at any of the above time points (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention).These findings were also consistent with the findings of an open RCT which demonstrated no significant between group differences in scores of ED-5Q, SF-36 PCS, SF 36 MCS, DPQ, Barthel, and MMSE which measure physical, mental, and social functioning (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention).One small (n=34) open RCT with a two week follow-up detected a significantly higher improvement in pain scores at 1 day after the intervention in vertebroplasty group compared with conservative treatment group. However, at 2 weeks follow-up, this difference was smaller and was not statistically significant.Conservative treatment was associated with fewer clinically important complicationsRisk of new VCFs following vertebroplasty was higher than those in conservative treatment but it requires further investigation.

METHOD(S): Frailty was defined as meeting one or more of the following components: (a) unintentional weight loss of >10 pounds, (b) weakness, (c) self-reported exhaustion, and (d) slow walking speed. Sociodemographic factors, Mini-Mental State Examination, medical conditions (stroke, heart attack, diabetes, arthritis, cancer, and hypertension), and depressive symptoms were obtained. Main outcome measure was risk of becoming frail over 10 years. RESULT(S): Out of 942 participants who were nonfrail at baseline (1995-1996), 57.8% were women and the mean age was 73.7 years (SD = 5.3). In general estimation equation models testing the relationship between Mini-Mental State Examination (=21) and the risk of becoming frail over a 10-year period, there was a significant association (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 1.00-1.19; p = .0310)] between the cognition-by-time interaction and odds of becoming prefrail or frail over time. This association was independent of age, sex, marital status, education, time, and medical conditions, indicating that nonfrail participants with poor cognition had a 9% odds per year of becoming frail over time compared with those with good cognition. CONCLUSION(S): Low Mini-Mental State Examination score was independently associated with increased risk of frailty over a 10-year period in older Mexican Americans. Low Mini-Mental State Examination score may be an early marker for future risk of frailty.

A domestic survey interviewed 343 individuals with 60 years or more, selected by a simple random sample. To identify the violence it was used the Conflict Tactics Scales. Information about identification, demographics and socio-economics characteristics were obtained using the National Health Interview Survey. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to evaluate mental health. In order to evaluate the functional capacity, the Health Assessment Questionnaire was used. In cases of alcohol suspicion among men, it was used theinstrument CAGE. To female elder or caregivers, the TWEAK instrument was used. 43% reported at least one episode of psychological violence. Physical iolence was reported by 9,6% of the interviewed, 6,1% reported serious physical violence in this period. The prevalence of different modalities of violence was higher among the youngest individuals, with higher scholarity, among those who have one of the pathologies that characterize the elderly as having a vulnerability (depression and / or urinary incontinence / fecal and / or diabetesand / or rheumatism) and those living with the greatest number of individuals.

Background and proximal factors from the need-driven dementia-compromised behavior model Algase, D.L., Beck, C., Kolanowski, A., Whall, A., Berent, S., Richards, K., et al. (1996). Need-driven dementia-compromised behavior: An alternative view of disruptive behavior. American Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, 5, 10-19] were examined as potential predictors of need-driven behaviors (NDBs) and resistiveness to care and CNA burden. METHOD(S): We used secondary data analysis of prospective data from 10 nursing homes in Birmingham, Alabama. One-hundred and sixty-one residents (83.43 +/- 8.56 years) with mini mental state examination (MMSE) score = 6.41 (+/- 6.66) were assessed via chart review, resident surveys, and surveys of CNAs. RESULT(S): Multiple regression models revealed that cognitive functioning, activities of daily living functioning, race, gender, and CNA-reported weekly resident pain intensity were associated with resident NDBs. Regression models also revealed that weekly pain intensity and medical comorbidity were associated with CNA burden associated with the resident NDBs. However, we were unable to explain a significant amount of variance in the resistiveness to care or CNA burden associated with resistiveness to care. DISCUSSION: Results underscore the role of pain in both resident NDBs and associated CNA burden. Future research should focus on predictors of resident resistiveness to care and the relation of pain assessment and management practices to CNA burden. Moreover, interventions to improve resident care should seek to include CNAs in institutional pain assessment and management processes.

Loose verbal communication of pain in older people with dementia	International Psychogeriatrics	Int.Psychogeriatr.	2019	 	 	31	 	31	 	aged;*Alzheimer disease;analgesia;caregiver;conference abstract;controlled study;*experimental pain;human;*language;learning;Mini Mental State Examination;nociception;nonverbal communication;pain assessment;qualitative analysis;quantitative analysis;reaction time;relative;self report	About half of the elderly people with dementia have frequent pain, as other old adults do. Moreover, a substantial number of studies indicate that pain sensitivity in old people with Alzheimer's disease is intact and may even be increased. However, their pain is difficult to recognize and to assess and, therefore, it is difficult to treat. Hence, the worrisome situation of the data indicates that affectation of the cognitive-evaluative nociceptive pathways and the poor self-report due to progressive loss of verbal communication make pain to be underdiagnosed and undertreated in people with cognitive impairment, especially dementia. In the context of COST Action TD1005, 'Pain in Cognitive Impairment, especially Dementia', the Spanish PAIC-team was interested to determine the contribution of verbal and non-verbal communication patterns in response to experimental pain. 66-85 years old people with Alzheimer's, vascular or mixt dementias and 3-6 Reisberg GDS stage and age-matched relatives (controls) participated in the study. The measurement of the latency of verbal and non-verbal responses to different intensities of a nociceptive mechanical stimuli (pressure) indicated that the patients exhibited longer reaction times, which negatively correlated with the level of cognitive impairment (MMSE) and their GDS. They also required more attempts to quantify their pain, by presence/absence of pain and by its intensity. They confronted difficulties to provide an answer using a verbal numeric scale, and when they did so most of the times it was in disagreement with the level of pressure administered. The number of attempts and corresponding trial-error did not result in learning and a better answer. A semantic analysis of the language expressions showed that the older people with dementia used more and a wider array of expressions to qualify their perceptions than the healthy controls. According to the content, verbal answers were classified in 13 categories. Among them, 'intensity' and 'comparison' were the most common and accurate answers provided by the patients. Thus, the use of language for a qualitative evaluation of events is more feasible and useful as compared to the consistent failure of the quantitative reports of the same subjects. These patterns of 'loose' verbal communication can be useful for professionals and caregivers for pain management in dementia and as complementary to observational pain scales.

Clinical Need and Target Population: Osteoporosis and associated fractures are important health issues in ageing populations. Vertebral compression fracture secondary to osteoporosis is a cause of morbidity in older adults. VCFs can affect both genders, but are more common among elderly females and can occur as a result of a fall or a minor trauma. The fracture may occur spontaneously during a simple activity such as picking up an object or rising up from a chair. Pain originating from the fracture site frequently increases with weight bearing. It is most severe during the first few weeks and decreases with rest and inactivity. Traditional treatment of painful VCFs includes bed rest, analgesic use, back bracing and muscle relaxants. The comorbidities associated with VCFs include deep venous thrombosis, acceleration of osteopenea, loss of height, respiratory problems and emotional problems due to chronic pain. Percutaneous vertebroplasty is a minimally invasive surgical procedure that has gained popularity as a new treatment option in the care for these patients. The technique of vertebroplasty was initially developed in France to treat osteolytic metastasis, myeloma, and hemangioma. The indications were further expanded to painful osteoporotic VCFs and subsequently to treatment of asymptomatic VCFs. The mechanism of pain relief, which occurs within minutes to hours after vertebroplasty, is still not known. Pain pathways in the surrounding tissue appear to be altered in response to mechanical, chemical, vascular, and thermal stimuli after the injection of the cement. It has been suggested that mechanisms other than mechanical stabilization of the fracture, such as thermal injury to the nerve endings, results in immediate pain relief. Percutaneous Vertebroplasty: Percutaneous vertebroplasty is performed with the patient in prone position and under local or general anesthesia. The procedure involves fluoroscopic imaging to guide the injection of bone cement into the fractured vertebral body to support the fractured bone. After injection of the cement, the patient is placed in supine position for about 1 hour while the cement hardens. Cement leakage is the most frequent complication of vertebroplasty. The leakages may remain asymptomatic or cause symptoms of nerve irritation through compression of nerve roots. There are several reports of pulmonary cement embolism (PCE) following vertebroplasty. In some cases, the PCE may remain asymptomatic. Symptomatic PCE can be recognized by their clinical signs and symptoms such as chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, cyanosis, coughing, hemoptysis, dizziness, and sweating. Research Methods Literature Search: A literature search was performed on Feb 9, 2010 using OVID MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, EMBASE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Cochrane Library, and the International Agency for Health Technology Assessment (INAHTA) for studies published from January 1, 2005 to February 9, 2010. Studies were initially reviewed by titles and abstracts. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained and reviewed. Reference lists were also examined for any additional relevant studies not identified through the search. Articles with an unknown eligibility were reviewed with a second clinical epidemiologist and then a group of epidemiologists until consensus was established. Data extraction was carried out by the author. Inclusion Criteria Study design: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing vertebroplasty with a control group or other interventions Study population: Adult patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures Study sample size: Studies included 20 or more patients English language full-reports Published between Jan 1 2005 and Feb 9 , 2010 (eligible studies identified through the Auto Alert function of the search were also included) Exclusion Criteria Non-randomized studies Studies on conditions other than VCF (e.g. patients with multiple myeloma or metastatic tumors) Studies focused on surgical techniques Studies lacking outcome measures Results of Evidence-Based Analysis: A systematic search yielded 168 citations. The titles and the abstracts of the citations were reviewed and full text of the identified citations was retrieved for further consideration. Upon review of the full publications and applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 5 RCTs were identified. Of these, two compared vertebroplasty with sham procedure, two compared vertebroplasty with conservative treatment, and one compared vertebroplasty with balloon kyphoplasty. Randomized Controlled Trials: Recently, the results of two blinded randomized placebo-controlled trials of percutaneous vertebroplasty were reported. These trials, providing the highest quality of evidence available to date, do not support the use of vertebroplasty in patients with painful osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. Based on the results of these trials, vertebroplasty offer no additional benefit over usual care and is not risk free. In these trials the treatment allocation was blinded to the patients and outcome assessors. The control group received a sham procedure simulating vertebroplasty to minimize the effect of expectations and to reduce the potential for bias in self-reporting of outcomes. Both trials applied stringent exclusion criteria so that the results are generalizable to the patient populations that are candidates for vertebroplasty. In both trials vertebroplasty procedures were performed by highly skilled interventionists. Multiple valid outcome measures including pain, physical, mental, and social function were employed to test the between group differences in outcomes. Prior to these two trials, there were two open randomized trials in which vertebroplasty was compared with conservative medical treatment. In the first randomized trial, patients were allowed to cross over to the other arm and had to be stopped after two weeks due to the high numbers of patients crossing over. The other study did not allow cross over and recently published the results of 12 months follow-up. The following is the summary of the results of these 4 trials: Two blinded RCTs on vertebroplasty provide the highest level of evidence available to date. Results of these two trials are supported by findings of an open randomized trial with 12 months follow-up. Blinded RCTs showed: * No significant differences in pain scores of patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure as measured at 3 days, 2 weeks and 1 month in one study and at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months in the other. * The observed differences in pain scores between the two groups were neither statistically significant nor clinically important at any time points. * The above findings were consistent with the findings of an open RCT in which patients were followed for 12 months. This study showed that improvement in pain was similar between the two groups at 3 months and were sustained to 12 months. * In the blinded RCTs, physical, mental, and social functioning were measured at the above time points using 4-5 of the following 7 instruments: RDQ, EQ-5D, SF-36 PCS, SF-36 MCS, AQoL, QUALEFFO, SOF-ADL * There were no significant differences in any of these measures between patients who received vertebroplasty and patients who received a sham procedure at any of the above time points (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention). * These findings were also consistent with the findings of an open RCT which demonstrated no significant between group differences in scores of ED-5Q, SF-36 PCS, SF 36 MCS, DPQ, Barthel, and MMSE which measure physical, mental, and social functioning (with a few exceptions in favour of control intervention). * One small (n=34) open RCT with a two week follow-up detected a significantly higher improvement in pain scores at 1 day after the intervention in vertebroplasty group compared with conservative treatment group. However, at 2 weeks follow-up, this difference was smaller and was not statistically significant. * Conservative treatment was associated with fewer clinically important complications * Risk of new VCFs following vertebroplasty was higher than those in conservative treatment but it requires further investigation.

Method(s): Patients not on anticholinergic treatment for OAB and experiencing urinary incontinence (>=1 episode/week) and micturition frequency (>=8 episodes/day) or urgency (>=1 episode/week) were enrolled in this 4-week, open-label study. Satisfaction, efficacy, mental status and adverse events were evaluated by urologists, gynecologists, urogynecologists and family practitioners. The analyses compared the outcomes in patients =65 years. Clinical trial registration: ISRCTN 19242032. Result(s): A total of 240 patients enrolled; 111 (46%) were >=65 years of age. Completion rate was 76.0% (=65) (p= 0.0204). Medication was rated as tolerable by 75.2% of patients =65 (p=0.0099). Based on overall satisfaction scores 64.2% (patient scores) and 57.1% (physician scores) of patients were considered 'successfully treated' (p=0.0001 & p=0.0451). There was a significant reduction in incontinence (64.3%; p=0.0001), nocturia (38.6%; p=0.0001) and night-time incontinence (39.7%; p=0.0436) with no difference between age groups. Total continence was achieved by 29.8% and 47.5% of patients =65, respectively (p=0.0077). No patients clinically experienced confusion or delirium and only six patients >=65 had a decrease in MMSE score of >=3 units, which was not statistically different from patients =65, respectively (p=0.0077). No patients clinically experienced confusion or delirium and only six patients >=65 had a decrease in MMSE score of >=3 units, which was not statistically different from patients =65 (p=0.0584). Limitations of the study include a fixed dosing, no control group and 4-week trial. Conclusion(s): Patients and physicians were satisfied with CR oxybutynin 15mg once-daily. Patients tolerated the CR oxybutynin 15mg as both the initial and maintenance dose and provided significant reductions in incontinence, nocturia and night-time incontinence without a significant change in cognitive status. Total continence rates were significantly superior in patients >=65 and there was no difference in dry mouth, cognitive status or efficacy in patients =65. © 2012 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

Method(s): Sixteen PDD patients (six female) with onset of cognitive impairment after at least one year with parkinsonism participated in this open-label trial of galantamine. Cognitive, psychiatric, and motor symptoms were assessed before and after 8 weeks of treatment with galantamine using unstructured clinical assessment as well as rating scales including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), clock drawing test, verbal fluency and selected items from the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Result(s): Age (mean, SD) was 75.6 (5.2) years, duration of PD 13.4 (5.9), duration of dementia 2.1 (1.7) years, Hoehn and Yahr score was 3.8 (0.8) and baseline MMSE score was 17.7 (6.7). Side-effects caused discontinuation in three patients, but were rare and mild in the remaining 13. Improvement of global mental symptoms was noted in eight patients, whereas worsening was reported in four. Hallucinations improved in seven of the nine patients with hallucinations before treatment. Parkinsonism improved in six patients, but a mild worsening of tremor was noted in three. Clock-drawing improved (p = 0.016), and trends towards improvement on MMSE (p = 0.09) and verbal fluency (p = 0.16) were found. Conclusion(s): Although controlled trials are needed, the findings suggest that galantamine is useful in patients with PDD. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Method(s): This was a double blind, randomised and placebo controlled, crossover study in which 14 patients with PD and cognitive impairment received donepezil (5 or 10 mg per day) or matching placebo during two sequential periods lasting 10 weeks each. The primary outcome measures were the mini mental state examination (MMSE) score, the clinician's interview based impression of change plus caregiver input (CIBIC+) score, and the motor subscale of the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). Result(s): Two patients on donepezil (14%) dropped out after one and four weeks of the first treatment period because of peripheral cholinergic side effects, otherwise the adverse effects were few and not severe. Carryover or residual effects were not observed. Parkinsonism did not increase during donepezil treatment. After 10 weeks of treatment, the mean MMSE score was increased by 2.1 (SD 2.7) points on donepezil and 0.3 (SD 3.2) points on placebo, and the CIBIC+ score was 3.3 (SD 0.9) on donepezil and 4.1 (SD 0.8) on placebo. Statistical analysis of the repeated measurements and crossover study design showed significant effects of donepezil compared with placebo for MMSE (p=0.013) and CIBIC+ (p=0.034). Five (42%) patients on donepezil and two (17%) on placebo were rated as improved on the basis of the CIBIC+ score. Conclusion(s): Donepezil improves cognition, and seems to be well tolerated and not to worsen parkinsonism in patients with cognitive impairment.

The present study assessed differences in depression and cognitive outcomes for three different pulse amplitudes during an acute ECT series. We hypothesized that the lower amplitudes would maintain the antidepressant efficacy of the standard treatment and reduce the risk of neurocognitive impairment. Method(s): This double-blind investigation randomized subjects to three treatment arms: 600, 700, and 800 mA (active comparator). Clinical, cognitive, and imaging assessments were conducted pre-, mid- and post-ECT. Subjects had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, age range between 50 and 80 years, and met clinical indication for ECT. Result(s): The 700 and 800 mA arms had improvement in depression outcomes relative to the 600 mA arm. The amplitude groups showed no differences in the primary cognitive outcome variable, the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R) retention raw score. However, secondary cognitive outcomes such as the Delis Kaplan Executive Function System Letter and Category Fluency measures demonstrated cognitive impairment in the 800 mA arm. Discussion(s): The results demonstrated a dissociation of depression (higher amplitudes better) and cognitive (lower amplitudes better) related outcomes. Future work is warranted to elucidate the relationship between amplitude, electric field, neuroplasticity, and clinical outcomes.Copyright © 2020 The Authors	ID: 2006988309; M1: (Abbott, Quinn, Miller, Ye, Iqbal, Lloyd, Jones, Upston) Department of Psychiatry, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States; M1: (Deng) Noninvasive Neuromodulation Unit, Experimental Therapeutics and Pathophysiology Branch, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States; M1: (Erhardt) Department of Mathematics and Statistics, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, United States; M1: (McClintock) Division of Psychology, Department of Psychiatry, UT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX, United States; M1: (Deng, McClintock) Division of Brain Stimulation and Neurophysiology, Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, United States	 		 	 	Elsevier B.V	Netherlands				 	1064-7481; 1545-7214	 	C.C.

This study provides a reliable Arabic version of the TYM with better validity indices in more-educated elderly adults, and it indicates that level of education greatly affects TYM results. Other points of weakness of the TYM include the effect of sensory impairment and the use of points for help in the total score because it allows for some assessor input. The crucial question concerns whether this indicates invalidity of the scale in elderly adults with lower levels of education, because educational level is also related to risk of cognitive impairment in elderly people.

Although dopaminergic dysfunction has traditionally been considered as the principal cause of these symptoms, the detail mechanisms are still unclear. Conventional treatment for VH, decrease of dopamine agonists, and use of antipsychotic medications often lead to an exacerbation of motor symptoms and excessive sedation. Gabapentin (GPT) is an antiepilepsy drug, which affects the glutamic acid neuron system and the γ-amino butyric acid neuron system. It is also known to have an analgesic effect. Here, we report a case of PD in which GPT improved both VH and pain without any adverse effects. Methods: This study is a case report. Results: The subject is an 81-year-old Japanese man who was diagnosed with PD at the age of 67 years. His Hoehn and Yahr staging scale was IV. He developed VH of insects and also experienced pain, which is, as he described, caused by these insects invading his body. Despite the general treatments, VH and pain persisted. Moreover, exacerbation of motor symptoms and excessive sedation hindered a further attempt. Gabapentin was administered to ease his pain. After that, not only pain but also VH disappeared without any adverse effects. Conclusions: The positive outcomes of GPT on VH and pain without any adverse effects may offer us a useful alternative treatment for PD. Further experience and study are needed to prove the efficacy of this agent. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)	ID: 2016-05428-011; Accession Number: 2016-05428-011.

Sleep quality is a major concern among persons with OA, with 60% of patients reporting nocturnal pain. Pain interferes with sleep and disturbed sleep lowers the pain threshold. Pain initiates and exacerbates sleep disturbance, whereas disturbed sleep maintains and exacerbates pain. Objectives To explore the potential impact of improving sleep by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) on OA pain and functional outcomes. Methods 118 patients, mean age 68.2 years with primary knee OA were recruited in this 12-week randomized controlled trial. Eligibility criteria included persons with both clinically significant persistent knee pain defined as >40 mm on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (VAS)/daily pain and clinically significant insomnia defined by self-reported sleep difficulties (trouble falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking up too early ect.) at least 3 nights/week during the past month. Exclusion criteria included rheumatoid arthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea, any primary sleep disorder, dementia and cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to a combined CBT and usual care intervention group (n=59) or to a usual care control group (n=59). The CBT consisted of twelve weekly sessions on pain and sleep management rationale, sleep hygiene education, stimulus control and sleep restriction. Primary outcome measures included pain reduction and improvement in sleep. Insomnia was assessed using the sleep diary and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) total item score. Secondary outcomes included improvements in physical function scores assessed by using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and activities of daily living (ADL). Ancillary outcomes included cognitive function assessed by the mini mental state examination (MMSE), depression assessed by the geriatric depression scale (GDS) and medication use. Results CBT subjects as compared to the usual care group reported significantly improved sleep and significantly reduced pain after treatment. In the intervention group there was a statistically significant reduction in insomnia severity (score range 0-27) compared to the control group (mean treatment difference = -1.85, 95% CI = -2.73 to -0.97; P<0.001). Post-treatment there was a clinically relevant reduction in the intervention group compared to the control group for knee pain. The mean difference between treatment arms (95% CI was 9.9 (1.8 to 18.0); p<0.005. The intervention group had better functioning than participants continuing usual care group as assessed by WOMAC-function scores and ADLs. Post-treatment MMSE and GDS scores showed improvement in the intervention group compared to the placebo group. A positive correlation was found between insomnia severity and knee pain, r=0.585; p<0.001. Conclusions The study indicates that CBT was effective for older adults with OA pain and insomnia. CBT improved functional outcomes and depression. The findings, support the hypothesis that improving sleep, per se, in patients with OA may be analgesic, such that perceived pain is reduced without being specifically targeted. These results further suggest that techniques to improve sleep, such as CBT should be considered as additions to the therapeutic armamentarium for pain management in OA.

Imagery training is a recommended, yet underresearched, approach in PD rehabilitation. Dynamic Neuro-Cognitive Imagery (DNI™) is a codified method for imagery training. Twenty subjects with idiopathic PD (Hoehn and Yahr stages I–III) were randomly allocated into DNI training (experimental; n = 10) or in-home learning and exercise program (control; n = 10). Both groups completed at least 16 hours of training within two weeks. DNI training focused on anatomical embodiment and kinesthetic awareness. Imagery abilities, disease severity, and motor and nonmotor functions were assessed pre- and postintervention. The DNI participants improved (p < 05) in mental imagery abilities, disease severity, and motor and spatial cognitive functions. Participants also reported improvements in balance, walking, mood, and coordination, and they were more physically active. Both groups strongly agreed they enjoyed their program and were more mentally active. DNI training is a promising rehabilitation method for improving imagery ability, disease severity, and motor and nonmotor functions in people with PD. This training might serve as a complementary PD therapeutic approach. Future studies should explore the effect of DNI on motor learning and control strategies.

Two factor structures were derived. A 2-factor solution, explaining 36.5% of the variance and statistically and conceptually different from those obtained in previous studies, distinguished between Perceptual-Organizational and Psychomotor skills. A 4-factor solution, which explained 56.1% of the variance, included a factor named Executing Psychomotor Commands, while also further differentiating the perceptual-organizational processes into the factors of Memory, Concentration, and Language. While the 2-factor solution is statistically and conceptually limited, the 4-factor solution of the MMSE maps well onto commonly recognized dimensions of neurocognitive ability. It offers a stable, sound, and statistically supported framework for clinical differentiation of cognitive screening data.

The resulting deafferentation may increase the experience of pain in VaD and in AD. The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between CRF and pain in a sample of 107 cognitively impaired nursing home patients who had also a chronic pain condition. The prevalence of pain in patients with hypertension or diabetes mellitus was higher (25/41 = 61% of them had pain) than those without diabetes or hypertension (of whom 24/66 = 36.4% had pain, p = 0.017). In a multivariate logistic regression model (adjusted for gender, age and depression) the presence of diabetes or hypertension was a risk indicator for pain: odds ratio: 3.48, p = 0.005, 95% CI: 1.45-8.38. This finding supports the hypothesis that as a result of CRF, disruptions of cortico-cortico and cortico-subcortical pathways occur, and consequently, enhances pain in this group of patients.

Pain in European long-term care facilities: Cross-national study in Finland, Italy and the Netherlands	Pain	Pain	2010	01	 	148	1	70	74	pain;European long term care facilities;Finland;Italy;Netherlands;cultural differences;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Female;Geriatric Assessment;Humans;Long-Term Care;Male;Neuropsychological Tests;Prevalence;Regression Analysis;Severity of Illness Index;Cross Cultural Differences;Long Term Care;Residential Care Institutions	There have been very few and limited cross-national comparisons concerning pain among residents of long-term care facilities in Europe. The aim of the present cross-sectional study has been to document the prevalence of pain, its frequency and severity as well as its correlates in three European countries: Finland (north), Italy (south) and the Netherlands (western central). Patients (aged 65 years or above) were assessed with the Minimum Data Set 2.0 (MDS).The final sample comprised 5761 patients from 64 facilities in Finland, 2295 patients from 8 facilities in the Netherlands and 1959 patients from 31 facilities in Italy. The prevalence of pain – defined as any type of pain – varied between 32% in Italy, 43% in the Netherlands and 57% in Finland. In nearly 50% of cases, pain was present daily; there were no significant differences in pain prevalence between patients with cancer diagnosis and those with non-cancer diagnosis. Regardless of the different prevalence estimates, pain was moderate-to-severe in over 50% of cases in all the countries. In multivariate logistic regression models, clinical correlates of pain were substantially similar across countries: pain was positively correlated with more severe physical disability (ADL impairment), clinical depression and a diagnosis of osteoporosis. Pain was negatively correlated with a diagnosis of dementia and more severe degrees of cognitive deterioration. We conclude that pain is frequently encountered in long-term care facilities in Europe and that, despite cultural and case-mix differences, pain speaks one language.

Yet, it is oftentimes undiagnosed because of difficulties in doing so. There are only two validated tools for detecting the CD in SLE patients. Traditional neuropsychologic testing (NPT), which consist of a variable battery of tests, administered and interpreted by a clinical psychologist, requiring 4 to 6 hours to complete, and costing oftentimes over $1000. And, the Automated Neuropsychologic Assessment Metrics (ANAM), a computerized battery of tests which assess some of the same cognitive domains as NPT, requires approximately 45 minutes, and costs approximately $400 for a software license. While more efficient and less costly, the ANAM is neither readily available nor practical for clinic administration or for screening larger populations. What is needed for both situations is a brief, sensitive, and reliable screening questionnaire. Method(s): The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Questionnaire (MoCA) has been developed and tested to identify mild cognitive impairment in the elderly. It is a brief (<10 mins), performance-based questionnaire that has been utilized in a number of other diseases with fair sensitivity (85-90%) and variable specificity (53-87%). The MoCA has never been utilized to screen for CD in patients with lupus. Patients with SLE fulfilling American College of Rheumatology criteria were recruited and evaluated. Demographic, clinical, and treatment information was obtained. In addition, depression was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and fatigue, pain, and overall well being scored on a 10 cm visual analogue scale. All subjects were administered the ANAM as the gold standard and the MoCA. The total throughput score (TTS) is a standard measure of cognitive performance of the ANAM. It is the average of the total number of correct responses/time required for those responses. Abnormal was defined as any score 2 SD or more below the mean established for a comparable rheumatoid arthritis population. The scores of the MoCA were compared to the TTS and the classification of normal or abnormal by the ANAM compared to that of the MoCA using various cutoffs. Descriptive statistics of the study population were computed. Using various cutpoints for the MoCA, the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios were also computed. Result(s): Fourty-four (44) patients have been recruited to date. Eleven (25%) were identified by the ANAM as being impaired in comparison to 13 (29.5%) by the MoCA. The scores of the two tests were significantly correlated (r =0.57, p <.001). Using the standard cut-off of 26, the sensitivity of MoCA was 83%, specificity 73%, accuracy 75%, with a positive predictive value of 50% and negative predictive value of 92% compared to ANAM. Other cut points were less efficient. Conclusion(s): The MoCA appears to be a useful screening tool for the detection of CD in SLE using the standard cutoff of 26. However, improved performance might be obtained by weighting individual questions differently or by developing additional items with enhanced discrimination.

The CDT, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the cognitive-functional independence measure (cognFIM) were used to assess cognitive status. Functional status outcome was evaluated by the functional independence measure, using absolute and relative parameters of efficacy and efficiency. Correlation coefficients (Pearson correlation) between the 3 cognitive tests resulted in r-values ranging from 0.51 to 0.59. All 3 tests correlated significantly with motor outcomes. MMSE did not confer additive value to CDT. It is concluded that CDT is similar to the MMSE and both are somewhat better than cognFIM with respect to the evaluation of functional status outcome following stroke. The correlations between the tests as well as the simplicity of administration favored the use of either CDT or MMSE in the initial assessment of elderly stroke patients. Absolute and relative functional gain parameters are appended. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)	ID: 2002-18295-004; Accession Number: 2002-18295-004.

F. Folstein et al, 1975, MMSE) in relation to education and the prevalence and incidence of dementia. 494 elderly individuals (aged 85 yrs) residing in Göteborg, Sweden, participated in the initial phase of the study, with 188 Ss completing a 3-yr follow-up neuropsychiatric examination. Collected data included MMSE scores and telephone interviews with close informants of Ss. Results show that among non-demented Ss, 75% of those who scored below the MMSE traditional cut-off score of 23/24 for dementia and 37% of those scoring 24–25 were diagnosed as demented at follow-up. Non-demented 85-yr-olds who did not display dementia at age 88 showed a minimal decline in MMSE score, while those who became demented decreased significantly. High and low MMSE score at baseline was related to a smaller decrease in MMSE score between ages 85 and 88. Higher education was related to higher scores on MMSE at age 85 and to a smaller decline in scores between age 85 and 88. Findings suggest that non-demented individuals scoring below 26 on the MMSE are at risk for developing dementia.

In our nursing home we arranged a pain assessment and treatment protocol and in 2010 we studied resident patients, January thru November, to test persistent pain, through VAS, functional outcome (Barthel Index and Tinetti) and physical therapy. Results The residents were 151 (included discharged, dead and still in-patients) and 55 (31%) experienced persistent pain. All 55 patients had pharmacological treatment. We analyzed data in t0 (when pain was pointed out)and in t1 (six months later). At t0 time VAS mean score 5,1, Barthel 28, MMSE 16.6, Tinetti 7.6 nd 19 patients (35%) had physical therapy (PT). Patients were divided into two groups for pain type. Group 1: 40 (72%) people had nociceptive pain and mean VAS was 5.1, Barthel 34.5, MMSE 17.5 and Tinetti 9.5 and 14 (32%) had PT; group 2 is made with 15 (28%) neurological pain patients and mean VAS was 5.2, Barthel 10.7, MMSE 14.1, Tinetti 2.5 and 6 (33%)had PT. Data were analyzed by TStudent: we noted a statistically significant difference between Barthel and Tinetti, higher in group 1 (p<0.05). Comparison between MMSE in groups who had and hadn't PT showed a significant difference in MMSE (p<0.05), higher in those who had (23,4 vs 13). Six month later (t1) only 40 were still in-patients. Mean VAS 3.2, Barthel 21.7, MMSE 15.2, Tinetti 6.3, 27 people hadn't PT, just 13 patients (35%) had PT and showed MMSE (mean value 24,3) and Tinetti (mean value 11,4) significantly higher than those who had not. Decrease in Barthel Index appears slower in PT group, but not statistically significant. Group 1 (nociceptive pain): 26 patients (65%), mean VAS was 3.1, Barthel 38, MMSE 19 and Tinetti 11 group 2 (neurological pain) 14 patients and mean VAS was 5.2, Barthel 11,5, MMSE 15, Tinetti 3. Conclusion Pharmacological therapy, together with physical therapy decrease VAS score; patients candidate for physical therapy shows higher MMSE and Tinetti scores and slower decrease in Barthel Index after a cycle.

Method(s): Patients aged 50 years and older who met the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Diseases and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for Alzheimer disease with an Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 12 and 26 (inclusive) were randomized to 10 weeks of double-blind treatment with either a 10 mg "low dose" of PF-04494700 (after a 6-d loading dose of 30 mg/d), a 20 mg "high dose" of PF-04494700 (after a loading dose of 60 mg/d), or placebo. Safety measures included adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Result(s): Twenty-seven patients received PF-04494700 30/co mg (female: 63%; mean age: 74.6 y; mean MMSE: 21.1), 28 patients received PF-04494700 60/20 mg (female: 57%; mean age: 76.6 y; mean MMSE: 21.6), and 12 patients received placebo (female: 67%; mean age: 74.1 y; mean MMSE: 19.2). A higher proportion of patients completed 10 weeks of double-blind treatment on both the "low-dose" regimen of PF-04494700 (88.9%) and the "high-dose" regimen (85.7%) than patients who were on placebo (66.7%). Discontinuation owing to adverse events and incidence of severe adverse events, respectively, were lower in the "low-dose" regimen (7.4%, 11.1%) and the "high-dose" regimen (3.6%, 10.7%) compared with placebo (25.0%, 16.7%). There were no clinically meaningful differences in vital signs, laboratory test results, or mean electrocardiogram parameters in patients treated with PF-04494700. PF-04494700 had no consistent effect on plasma levels of beta-amyloid, inflammatory biomarkers, or secondary cognitive outcomes. Conclusion(s): Ten weeks of treatment with PF-04494700 was safe and well tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease, indicating the feasibility of a larger long-term efficacy trial.

Material and methods: 168 participants from a memory clinic in Mexico City were enrolled and divided into 3 groups: 59 cognitively healthy (CHG), 52 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (DSM-5 criteria) and 57 with dementia (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria). The MoCA-S and Mini-Mental State Evaluation (MMSE) were applied at baseline and during the last months to establish intra-observer reliability. ROC curves and a multinomial regression model were constructed to evaluate the effect of age and education on MoCA-S performance. Results: The mean age of the participants was 76 ± 8.1 years and the education rate was 10.7 ± 5.2. The MoCA-S scores by group were: CHG, 27.3 ± 1.9; MCI, 22.9 ± 2.9; and dementia, 13.7 ± 4.9 (p <0.001). The reliability of the MoCA-S was 0.89 and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.955. Sensitivity was 80% and specificity was 75%, with a cut-off point of 26 points for MCI (area under the curve, 0.886; p < 0.001). For the dementia group, the sensitivity was 98% and specificity was 93%, with a cut-off point of 24points (area under the curve, 0.998; p < 0.001). The multinomial regression showed no association with education and age for both the MCI and dementia groups. Conclusions: The MoCA-S is a valid and reliable instrument for MCI and dementia screening in the Mexican population, even after adjusting for age and education.

In the present investigation oral and rectal administration of tacrine were compared with the aim to find a route for improved bioavailability through diminished firstpass metabolism in the liver. Eight patients suffering from Alzheimer's dementia were given tacrine by oral (25 and 50 mg b.i.d.) and rectal (12.5 and 25 mg b.i.d.) routes for 1 week with 4-6 weeks washout in between. Drug hydroxylation capacity in the patients was determined using the debrisoquine test. Levels of tacrine in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were determined and the cognitive performance was examined by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer Deficit Assessment Scale (ADAS). Tacrine was well tolerated in all but one patient, a slow hydroxylator, who developed an aplastic anemia. MMSE and ADAS scores did not significantly change, except for word recall which was improved on tacrine when given by the rectal route. Pharmacokinetic analysis of the two administration routes revealed that the drug dose may be reduced by almost 50% when given rectally compared to orally. Concentrations of tacrine in the CSF were significantly lower and correlated linearly with the concentrations in plasma.

Whereas ethnic disparities in pain in other minority groups compared with whites are well described, pain in Asian Americans remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to characterize differences in clinical pain intensity and experimental pain sensitivity among older Asian American and non-Hispanic white (NHW) participants with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Methods: Data were collected from 50 Asian Americans ages 45 to 85 (28 Korean, 9 Chinese, 7 Japanese, 5 Filipino, and 1 Indian) and compared with 50 age-matched and sex-matched NHW individuals with symptomatic knee OA pain. The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and Graded Chronic Pain Scale were used to assess the intensity of clinical knee pain. In addition, quantitative sensory testing was used to measure experimental sensitivity to heat-induced and mechanically induced pain. Results: Asian American participants had significantly higher levels of clinical pain intensity than NHW participants with knee OA. In addition, Asian American participants had significantly higher experimental pain sensitivity than NHW participants with knee OA. Discussion: These findings add to the growing literature regarding ethnic and racial differences in clinical pain intensity and experimental pain sensitivity. Asian Americans in particular may be at risk for clinical pain and heightened experimental pain sensitivity. Further investigation is needed to identify the mechanisms underlying ethnic group differences in pain between Asian Americans and NHWs, and to ensure that ethnic group disparities in pain are ameliorated.

Using the biopsychosocial model, we sought to determine whether variations in depression contribute to racial group differences in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis pain between Asian Americans and non-Hispanic white Americans. The sample consisted of 100 participants, including 50 Asian Americans (28 Korean Americans, 9 Chinese Americans, 7 Japanese Americans, 5 Filipino Americans, and 1 Indian American) and 50 age- and sex-matched non-Hispanic white Americans with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis pain. The Centers for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale was used to assess symptoms of depression, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index and the Graded Chronic Pain Scale were used to measure clinical pain. In addition, quantitative sensory testing was used to measure experimental sensitivity to heat- and mechanically-induced pain. The results indicated that higher levels of depression in Asian Americans may contribute to greater clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity. These findings add to the growing literature regarding ethnic and racial differences in pain and its associated psychological conditions, and additional research is warranted to strengthen these findings. Perspective: This article shows the contribution of depression to clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity in Asian Americans with knee osteoarthritis. Our results suggest that Asian Americans have higher levels of depressive symptoms and that depression plays a relevant role in greater clinical pain and experimental pain sensitivity in Asian Americans.

Background(s): Fatigue is a common and disabling non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Autonomic dysfunction is suggested as the possible pathophysiology of fatigue, but it has not been investigated in drug-naive PD patients. Method(s): In the present study, 89 drug-naive PD patients were analyzed. The Parkinson's disease fatigue scale (PFS) was used to divide the patients into fatigue (mean PFS >= 3.3) and non-fatigue groups (mean PFS = 0.999, p = 0.1, respectively. In deterioration group, 8 patients (80%) showed decreasing of frequency of taking analgesic with statistical significant (p < 0.05). Conclusion(s): In the PD patients with chronic headache, the number of analgesic use decreased significantly if symptoms of PD were deteriorated.

The Severe Cognitive Impairment Rating Scale (SCIRS) was developed to assess cognition in patients with severe dementia, but may also be useful in elderly people with delirium. Objective: We investigated the use of the SCIRS to assess cognition in elderly patients with delirium. Methods: We recruited 147 participants, aged ≥ 65 years, referred for psychiatric consultation at a tertiary-care university hospital. The diagnosis and severity of delirium were assessed using the Korean version of the Delirium Rating Scale-Revised-98 (K-DRS-98). Cognitive function was assessed using the SCIRS and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in the Korean version of the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer’s Disease (CERAD) Assessment Packet (MMSE-KC). Results: There was a strong correlation of SCIRS scores with K-DRS-98 cognition domain (r = −0.796), severity scores (r = −0.742), total scores (r = −0.734), and the MMSE-KC (r = 0.905). Analysis of variance incorporating the severity of delirium suggested that while the MMSE showed a floor effect, the SCIRS could discriminate between moderate and severe delirium. Conclusion: The SCIRS is a useful instrument to assess cognitive function in elderly patients with moderate to severe delirium.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are connected with vascular dementia, but less is known about cognitive functioning among elderly patients with CHD based on population studies.; Objective: To describe the associations between CHD and cognitive impairment among the elderly.; Population and Methods: Of the total population of the Lieto study (488 community-dwelling men and 708 women, >/=64 years old), the ambulatory patients with CHD (89 men and 73 women) and sex- and age-matched controls without any sign of CHD (178 men and 146 women) were selected to make up the study population. CHD was defined as the presence of angina pectoris or a past myocardial infarction. Cognitive assessment was based on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).; Results: The total MMSE scores, the MMSE subtest scores and the overall test-based cognitive functioning did not differ between patients and controls. Among men, higher MMSE subscores in orientation and language were related to more severe chest pain. According to logistic regression analyses, the cognitive impairment of men was associated with high age, the use of cardiac glycosides and physical disability. Among women, cognitive impairment was associated with high age and the use of antipsychotics.; Conclusion: In general, CHD has no independent association with cognitive impairment among the non-institutionalized community-living elderly. Among men, however, a complicated CHD may negatively affect cognitive functioning.	ID: 9933731; Accession Number: 9933731. Language: English. Date Revised: 20171101. Date Created: 19990206.

Stegman (1999) developed interference trials for forms 1, 3, 4, and 6 using the word lists from forms 2 and 5 (HVLT-1). Stegman found that the four forms were equivalent among 100 college students with regard to learning and all the free-recall trials, including immediate and delayed recall. The present study examined the equivalency of the two of the HVLT-1, Forms 1 and 3, in older veterans (56 to 88 years old). In addition, the current study collected normative data on two four forms. The equivalence of the two forms was examined using between-group subject research design. The Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) was used as a screening of general cognitive function to determine whether an individual's score would be included in the normative data set. Contrary to Stegman's findings, Form 1 and Form 3 were found to be different with respect to the free-recall trials, except for the immediate free-recall trial (Trial 4). However, consonant with previous research, the two forms were found to be equivalent in learning, percent retained, and true-positive responses. Consistent with previous research, differences were found between the false-positive responses in the two forms. Based on the results of this study, older veterans perform differently on Form 1 than do on Form 3. Form 1 reached ceiling levels in this population, while Form 3 did not. Therefore, Form 3 appears to be a better measure of episodic verbal memory in older adults than Form l. Implications of the differences in the two forms as related to age and education are discussed. Combined, as well as separate, normative data on the two forms is provided on all the 14 scores of the HVLT-I. The integrity of the HVLT and the HVLT-R are not maintained in Forms 1 and 3 of the HVLT-I. Given the significant differences between the forms, it is highly recommended that the two forms of the HVLT-I should not be used interchangeably in repeated testing.

METHOD(S): We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic effect of 3APS in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in which 58 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 3APS 50, 100, or 150 mg BID for 3 months. At the end of the double-blind phase, 42 of these subjects entered an open-label phase in which they received 3APS 150 mg BID for 17 months. Assessments included plasma and CSF 3APS concentrations, CSF levels of Abeta (Abeta40 and Abeta42), and total tau, as well as cognitive (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination) and clinical (Clinical Dementia Rating scale-Sum of Boxes) measures. RESULT(S): 3APS had no significant impact on vital signs or laboratory test values. The most frequent side effects were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were intermittent and mild to moderate in severity. Seven 3APS-treated subjects discontinued because of side effects (all causalities) over the course of the study, and there were no 3APS-related serious adverse events. 3APS crossed the blood-brain barrier, and dose-dependently reduced CSF Abeta42 levels after 3 months of treatment. There were no psychometric score differences between groups over the 3-month double-blind period. CONCLUSION(S): Long-term administration of 3-amino-1-propanesulfonic acid is safe, tolerated and reduces CSF Abeta42 levels in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer disease. ©2006AAN Enterprises, Inc.

Design and Methods: We assessed the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of tramiprosate in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study in which 58 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were randomly assigned to receive placebo or tramiprosate 50, 100, or 150 mg BID for 3 months. At the end of the double-blind study, 42 of these patients entered an open-label extension study in which they received tramiprosate 150 mg BID for an additional 17 months. Assessments included plasma and CSF tramiprosate concentrations, CSF Abeta42 concentrations, and psychometric tests (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and Clinical Dementia Rating Scale - Sum of Boxes). Result(s): Tramiprosate had no significant impact on vital signs or laboratory test values. The most frequent side effects were nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which were intermittent and mild-to-moderate in severity. Overall, six tramiprosate-treated patients discontinued because of side effects (all causalities) and there were no drug-related serious adverse events. Tramiprosate crossed the blood-brain barrier and dose-dependently reduced CSF Abeta42 levels after 3 months of treatment. There were no psychometric score differences between treatment groups after 3 months of double-blind treatment. However, psychometric score changes over the 17-month open-label extension study are consistent with a slowing of cognitive and clinical decline, particularly in mild subjects. Interpretation(s): Long-term administration of tramiprosate is safe and tolerated in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. The short-term reduction of CSF Abeta42 levels and the long-term open-label cognitive and clinical assessments are consistent with disease-modification. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.

Material(s) and Method(s): Double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial in 67 clinical centres across North America. Patients aged >= 50 years, with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score between 16 and 26) and on stable doses of cholinesterase inhibitors, alone or with memantine. Intervention(s): 78-week treatment with placebo, tramiprosate 100 mg or tramiprosate 150 mg BID. Measurements: Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) assessments were performed at baseline and every 13 weeks. Baseline and 78-week magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) hippocampus volume (HV) measurements were conducted in a subgroup of patients. Result(s): A total of 1,052 patients were enrolled and 790 (75.1%) completed the 78-week trial. Patient discontinuation and reasons for withdrawal were similar across groups. Planned analyses did not reveal statistically significant between-group differences. Lack of adequate statistical validity of the planned analysis models led to the development of revised predictive models. These adjusted models showed a trend toward a treatment effect for ADAS-cog (P = 0.098) and indicated significantly less HV loss for tramiprosate 100 mg (P = 0.035) and 150 mg (P = 0.009) compared to placebo. The incidence of adverse events was similar across treatment groups. Conclusion(s): The primary planned analyses did not show a significant treatment effect, but were confounded by unexplained variance. Post-hoc analyses showed a significant treatment-related reduction in HV loss. However, there was only a trend towards slowing of decline on the ADAS-cog and no slowing of decline on the CDR-SB. These results must be interpreted in consideration of the limitations of clinical and disease-modification outcome measures and their relationship, the heterogeneity of the disease and the impact of confounding demographic and clinical variables.

Objective(s): To determine whether treatment with a selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor (rofecoxib) or a traditional nonselective NSAID (naproxen) slows cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Design(s): Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial, with 1-year exposure to study medications. Setting(s): Forty ambulatory treatment centers affiliated with the Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study consortium. Participant(s): Participants with mild-to-moderate AD (Mini-Mental State Examination score of 13-26) were recruited from December 1999 to November 2000 using clinic populations, referrals from community physicians, and local advertising. Stable use of cholinesterase inhibitors, estrogen, low-dose aspirin, and vitamin E was allowed. Participants with inflammatory diseases that might respond to the study medications were excluded. Of 474 participants screened, 351 were enrolled. Intervention(s): Once-daily rofecoxib, 25 mg, or twice-daily naproxen sodium, 220 mg, or placebo. Main Outcome Measure(s): The primary outcome measure was the 1-year change in the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive (ADAS-Cog) subscale score. Secondary outcome measures included the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum-of-boxes, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Quality of Life-AD, and the time to attainment of significant end points (4-point decline from baseline ADAS-Cog score, 1-step worsening on the global Clinical Dementia Rating scale, 15-point decline on the ADCS activities of daily living inventory, institutionalization, or death). Result(s): The 1-year mean (SD) change in ADAS-Cog scores in participants treated with naproxen (5.8 8.0]) or rofecoxib (7.6 7.7]) was not significantly different from the change in participants treated with placebo (5.7 8.2]). Results of secondary analyses showed no consistent benefit of either treatment. Fatigue, dizziness, and hypertension were more commonly reported in the active drug groups, and more serious adverse events were found in the active treatment group than in the placebo group. Conclusion(s): The results of this study indicate that rofecoxib or low-dose naproxen does not slow cognitive decline in patients with mild-to-moderate AD.

Aim(s): The main aims of this study were to investigate the occurrence of delirium and identify the associated risk factors in a sample of hospitalized elderly in Southwestern Iran. Method(s): A cross-sectional, hospital-based study was performed on a total of 200 elderly patients, admitted to a general hospital for various health reasons. Data were gathered over a 3-month period of time in 2010. Abbreviated Mental Test score (AMTs) used for delirium detection in post-admission days 1, 3, and 5, followed by clinical diagnostic confirmation according to the DSM-IV-TR criteria for delirium. Information regarding physical, cognitive, emotional, and functional states of the participants was collected, too. Result(s): Delirium developed in 22 % of the participants. The demographic characteristics of the patients with delirium indicated that they were typically single, older men who lived alone and had a lower level of education and poorer functional status. Among other variables, the following were significantly associated with delirium: hemoglobin =1/20 (P < 0.005); and positive C-reactive protein (P = 0.022); depressive symptoms (P < 0.001), and previous cognitive decline (P < 0.001). Patients with more than six different categories of medications were at high risk for delirium as well. Conclusion(s): Delirium is a serious and common problem in people over 60 years of age who are admitted to hospitals. Understanding risk factors and clinical aspects of delirium in elderly hospitalized patients will provide us with a better delirium management strategy.Copyright © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Method(s): In this study, 377 older adults (mean age: 74.71 +/- 6.15 years) were examined. The Hodkinson Abbreviated Mental Test (HAMT) was used to describe cognitive function of the individuals. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL-4) survey tool was used to measure the quality of life. Possible influential factors of cognitive function were also detected. The following independent variables were included in the logistic regression analysis: age, gender, education level, residency, smoking habit, musculoskeletal pain, medication use, number of unhealthy mental days, number of unhealthy physical days, and activity limitation days. Result(s): The results indicated that the elderly with cognitive impairment showed low scores in terms of the three parameters of the CDC HRQOL-4. The findings also indicate that the following variables were found to significantly affect cognitive function: (1) age, (2) residency (rest home), (3) smoking (yes or quit), and (4) number of unhealthy mental days. Conclusion(s): Older adults should be assessed in terms of factors related to cognition, such as age, residency, smoking, and mood in order to plan the most suitable geriatric care.© 2013, Taiwan Society of Geriatric Emergency & Critical Care Medicine.

However, to date the effects of VTA-DBS on cognition, mood and quality of life have not been examined in detail. Method(s): The aim of the present study was to do so in a case series of 18 consecutive patients with cluster headache who underwent implantation of deep brain stimulation electrodes in the ventral tegmental area. The patients were evaluated preoperatively and after a mean of 14 months of VTA-DBS on tests of global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination), intelligence (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), verbal memory (California Verbal Learning Test-II), executive function (Delis-Kaplan Executive Function System), and attention (Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test). Depression (Beck Depression Inventory and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale-D), anxiety (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Rating Scale-A), apathy (Starkstein Apathy Scale), and hopelessness (Beck Hopelessness Scale) were also assessed. Subjective pain experience (McGill Pain Questionnaire), behaviour (Pain Behaviour Checklist) and quality of life (Short Form-36) were also evaluated at the same time points. Result(s): VTA-DBS resulted in significant improvement of headache frequency (from a mean of five to two attacks daily, p <.001) and severity (from mean Verbal Rating Scale VRS] of 10 to 7, p <.001) which was associated with significant reduction of anxiety (from mean HADS-A of 11.94 to 8.00, p <.001) and help-seeking behaviours (from mean PBC of 4.00 to 2.61, p <.001). VTA-DBS did not produce any significant change to any tests of cognitive function and any other outcome measures (BDI, HADS-D, SAS, BHS, McGill Pain Questionnaire, Short Form-36). Conclusion(s): We confirm the efficacy of VTA-DBS in the treatment of medically refractory chronic cluster headache. The reduction of headache frequency and severity was associated with a significant reduction of anxiety. Furthermore, the result suggests that VTA-DBS for chronic cluster headache improves pain-related help-seeking behaviours and does not produce any change in cognition.Copyright © International Headache Society 2019.

Corneal perforation in the form of peripheral ulcerative keratopathy can be debilitating and difficult to manage. A 48-year-old female with known RA presented with sudden loss of vision in her left eye, she was diagnosed with left corneal perforation secondary to severe dry eye. Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) and punctum occlusion were done. Amniotic membrane transplant (AMT) was done 1 month later due to nonhealing epithelial defect. Her RA was clinically inactive, and no changes in her current medications were made. However, 4 months later, she presented with a second corneal perforation with melting. She had another PKP and AMT with permanent temporal tarsorrhaphy. Cyclosporine 100 mg P. O. twice daily was added, but after 5 months, she presented again with a third left corneal perforation with melting. Again, PKP and AMT with tarsorrhaphy were done, and she was started on infliximab. Since then, she had a stable graft with no further corneal perforations. In summary, patients with RA can have corneal perforations even if other signs of RA are absent. If the systemic treatment that is used to treat RA fails, one should consider using other classes of drugs, such as monoclonal antibodies (e.g., rituximab), tumor necrosis factor alpha blockers (such as infliximab or adalimumab), interleukin (IL)-1 receptor antagonists (e.g., anakinra), or IL-6 receptor antagonist (e.g., tocilizumab).Copyright © 2020 Elsevier B.V..

Hand grip strength and incident ADL disability in elderly Mexican Americans over a seven-year period	Aging clinical and experimental research	Aging Clin Exp Res	2004	12	 	16	6	481	486	Disability Evaluation*;Mexican Americans*;Hand Strength/*physiology;Activities of Daily Living;Aged;Female;Follow-Up Studies;Humans;Male;Risk Factors;Time Factors	Background and Aims: Little is known about muscle strength as a predictor of disability among older Mexican Americans. The aim of this study was to examine the association between hand grip strength and 7-year incidence of ADL disability in older Mexican American men and women.; Methods: A 7-year prospective cohort study of 2493 non-institutionalized Mexican American men and women aged 65 or older residing in five south-western states. Maximal hand grip strength test, body mass index, cognitive function, activities of daily living, self-reports of medical conditions (arthritis, diabetes, heart attack, stroke, cancer, hip fracture), and depressive symptoms were obtained.; Results: In a Cox proportional regression analysis, there was a linear relationship between hand grip strength at baseline and risk of incident ADL disability over a 7-year follow-up. Among non-disabled men at baseline, the hazard ratio of any new ADL limitation was 1.90 (95% CI 1.14-3.17) for those in the lowest quartile, when compared with men in the highest hand grip strength quartile, after controlling for age, marital status, medical conditions, high depressive symptoms, MMSE score, and BMI at baseline. Among non-disabled women at baseline, the hazard ratio of any new ADL limitation was 2.28 (95% CI 1.59-3.27) for those in the lowest quartile, when compared with women in the highest hand grip strength quartile.; Conclusions: Hand grip strength is an independent predictor of ADL disability among older Mexican American men and women. The hand grip strength test is an easy, reliable, valid, inexpensive method of screening to identify older adults at risk of disability.	ID: 15739601; Accession Number: 15739601. Language: English.

Design: Cross‐sectional study involving a population‐based survey. Setting: Hispanic Established Population for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly survey conducted in the southwestern of United States (Texas, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and California). Participants: Seven hundred twenty‐eight Mexican‐American men and women aged 75 and older. Measurements: Sociodemographic factors, self‐reported physician diagnoses of medical conditions (arthritis, diabetes mellitus, heart attack, stroke, hip fracture, and cancer), depressive symptoms, cognitive function, body mass index (BMI), upper and lower extremity muscle strength, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), activities of daily living (ADLs), and the life‐space assessment (LSA) were assessed in in‐home interviews. Results: The mean age of participants was 84.2 ± 4.2. Sixty‐five percent were female. Mean LSA score was 41.7 ± 20.9. Multiple regression analysis showed that older age, being female, limitation in ADLs, stroke, high depressive symptoms, and a BMI index of 35 kg/m2 and greater were significantly associated with lower LSA scores. Education and better lower extremity function and muscle strength were factors significantly associated with higher LSA scores. Conclusion: Older Mexican Americans had restricted life‐space, with approximately 80% limited to their home or neighborhood. Older age, female sex, stroke, high depressive symptoms, BMI of 35 kg/m2 or greater, and ADL disability were related to less life‐space. Future studies are needed to examine the association between life‐space and health outcomes and to characterize the trajectory of life‐space over time in this population.

The MMSE subscores for attention, memory, and construction were retrospectively compared for the 1st available MMSE exam for (deceased) patients with DLB (n=17; mean age 75.0 yrs) or AD (n=27; mean age 79.7 yrs). The attention and construction subtest scores of the DLB group were worse than those of the AD group. The memory subscores of the DLB group were better, although the difference did not reach statistical significance. When a mathematical equation was used to combine the 3 subscores with equal weighting, the scores of the DLB group were worse. Using this equation, 3 a score less than 5 points was associated with DLB with a sensitivity of 0.82 and a specificity of 0.81. Findings support the work of others regarding the relative neuropsychological impairments of DLB and AD and indicate that the MMSE may be helpful in the differentiation of DLB and AD.

Result(s): 32 patients were interviewed, obtaining a median of 86.5+/-78 in Parkinson's disease sleep scale, with 31.3% of patients with a score below 86 points, a median of 21+/-16 in MOCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment), with 48.1% of patients below 14, and a median of 18.5+/-13.2 in Beck Depression inventory with 59% of patients within the category of moderate-severe depression. 93.7% of the patients presented both hyposmia and pain, and all of them, some dysautonomic symptom. Being a woman 0.072 95% CI (0.007-0.713), p=0.025], and a shorter illness time 0.834, 95% CI (0.692-0.999), p=0.05], protects against a worse quality of sleep. The worst results in MOCA were related with the time of illness 3,741 (95% CI 3.7-12.5), p=0.01), however, in the multivariate analysis the association was lost. The presence of premotor symptoms was associated in the univariate analysis with a worse score in Beck's inventory OR: 4.81, 95% CI (1,001-25.65), p=0.05], without remaining in the multivariate. Conclusion(s): Patients with APD submitted to DBS present significant amount of NMS.

Mechanism underlying DDS are not clear, although it has been linked to dysfunctional brain reward networks. The prevalence in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients is 4%. Age at onset and novelty-seeking personality traits are considered to be the two strongest predictors of DDS in PD patients. Pain is very frequent in individuals with Parkinson's disease and may partially respond to L-dopa (LD). Our hypothesis is that off related pain may represent an internal cue to increase the demand of therapy within a behavioral addiction LD-related. Method(s): Eighty PD patients were randomly recruited, according to these exclusion criteria: (a) with a long duration of disease (more than 15 years) (b) with a cognitive impairment (MMSE < 23). We analyzed the following variables: sex, age, duration of disease, Hoehn & Yahr stage, UPDRS score, dopamine dose equivalent per day (DDED), DDS score item (UPDRS), King Pain Scale score, the Parkinson's disease Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders Questionnaire (QUIP) score. Result(s): A positive DDS UPDRS score is present in 22% of our sample PD patients, and it correlates significantly with fluctuation-related King pain score (p < 0.001). A positive QUIP score, describing an impulsive behavior, such as compulsive shopping, punding, hypersexuality, gambling , is present in half of cases with DDS. In our sample, the DDED is higher in the group with chronic pain compared with the group without (p < 0.042). Conclusion(s): In our population of study, patients with DDS show frequently other type of compulsive behavior. These patients present a positive correlation with motor fluctuation-related pain. Even if this type of pain may be alleviated by LD, its intake may increase the quote of impulsivity and at end favorite pain again. These findings may encourage new therapeutical strategies aimed to reduce pain in PD, by abolishing extradoses of LD and treating directly impulsivity.

We compared Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) performance and self-reported cognitive impairment in 699 EOPD participants genotyped for mutations in parkin (PRKN), leucine-rich repeat kinase-2 (LRRK2), and GBA. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between reported cognitive impairment and MMSE score, as well as between GBA group membership and self-reported impairment and MMSE. GBA carriers reported more impairment, but MMSE performance did not differ among genetic groups. Detailed neuropsychological testing is required to explore the association between cognitive impairment and GBA mutations.

The role of continuity of systematic treatment and rehabilitation in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer in elderly and senile age	Journal of Clinical Oncology	J.Clin.Oncol.	2020	 	 	38	15	 	 	adult;age;aged;*algorithm;cancer chemotherapy;*cancer patient;cancer staging;case report;chronic pain;clinical article;clock drawing test;cognition;conference abstract;daily life activity;elevated blood pressure;functional disease;Geriatric Depression Scale;geriatrics;health status;human;male;*metastatic colorectal cancer;middle aged;Mini Mental State Examination;nutritional assessment;nutritional status;rating scale;rehabilitation;unclassified drug	Background: The concomitant pathology, cancer and geriatric status affect the organism of a sick elderly person. In routine clinical practice elderly patients require comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGO). Despite many treatment strategies for elderly patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), there are no use of rehabilitation programs and the assessment of their impact on the treatment tolerability and survival. Method(s): The study includes patients with newly diagnosed mCRC stage IV, receiving the first line of chemotherapy (FOLFOX). Patients are given CGO before starting chemotherapy and in dynamics.The following scales are used for geriatric examination: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics (CIRS-G); Activities of Daily Living (ADL); Daily instrumental activity scale (IADL); Mini nutritional assessment (MNA); Clock Drawing Test (CDT); Geriatric depression scale (GDS). Result(s): At the moment 29 patients are included in the study. According the results of CGO we determined that elderly and middle-aged patients are similar in cognitive, mental, and nutritional status, but they have statistically significant differences on the MMSE scale (P=0,014). In both groups patients have a decrease in IADL and cognitive functions, the presence of depression. Elderly patients (> 60 years old) are more likely to experience chronic pain (P<0.05) and increased blood pressure (P<0.05) (Table). Conclusion(s): The management tactics of patients with mCRC in elderly age shouldn't be based only on chronological age, ECOG or the Karnovsky index, that don't reflect functional disorders in patients of the older age group. It is necessary to define algorithms for medical rehabilitation in cancer patients of the older age group. A CGO is aimed at developing a medical rehabilitation plan together with an elderly patient and his environment, and an algorithm for supporting his health status during and after specialized treatment.

Not every patient responds to pharmacological therapies, thus alternative treatments have to be developed. The chronicity of pain can lead to a somatic dysperception, meaning a mismatch between patients’ own body perception and its actual physical state. Since clinical evaluation of pain relies on patients’ subjective reports, a body image disruption can be associated with an incorrect pain rating inducing incorrect treatment and a possible risk of drug abuse. Our aim was to reduce chronic low-back pain through a multimodal neurorehabilitative strategy using innovative technologies to help patients regain a correct body image. Methods: Twenty patients with chronic low-back pain were included. Before and after treatment, patients underwent: a neurological exam; a neuro-psychological evaluation testing cognitive functions (memory, attention, executive functions) and personality traits, QoL and mood; pain ratings; sensorimotor functional abilities’ testing. Patients underwent a 6 week-neurorehabilitative treatment (total 12 sessions) using virtual reality (VRRS system, Khymeia, Italy). Treatment consisted on teaching patients to execute correct movements with the painful body parts to regain a correct body image, based on the augmented multisensory feedback (auditory, visual) provided by the VRRS. Results: Our data showed significant reductions in all pain rating scale scores (p < 0.05); significant improvements of QoL in the domains of physical functioning, physical role functioning, bodily pain, vitality, and social role functioning; improvements in cognitive functions (p < 0.05); improvements in functional scales (p < 0.05) and mood (p = 0.04). Conclusion: This non-pharmacological approach was able to act on the multi-dimensional aspects of pain and improved patients’ QoL, pain intensity, mood and patient’s functional abilities.

Validation of the German Revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination for detecting mild cognitive impairment, mild dementia in Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal lobar degeneration	Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders	Dement.Geriatr.Cogn.Disord.	2010	06	 	29	5	448	456	Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised;test validity;mild cognitive impairment;dementia;Alzheimer's disease;frontotemporal lobar degeneration;psychometrics;Aged;Alzheimer Disease;Cognition Disorders;Data Interpretation, Statistical;Diagnosis, Differential;Education;Female;Germany;Humans;Language;Male;Mental Recall;Middle Aged;Neuropsychological Tests;ROC Curve;Regression Analysis;Reproducibility of Results;Cognitive Impairment;Neurodegeneration;Brain Damage;Diagnosis;Frontal Lobe;Temporal Lobe	Background/Aims: The diagnostic accuracy of the German version of the revised Addenbrooke’s Cognitive Examination (ACE-R) in identifying mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild dementia in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and mild dementia in frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) in comparison with the conventional Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was assessed. Methods: The study encompasses 76 cognitively healthy elderly individuals, 75 patients with MCI, 56 with AD and 22 with FTLD. ACE-R and MMSE were validated against an expert diagnosis based on a comprehensive diagnostic procedure. Statistical analysis was performed using the receiver operating characteristic method and regression analyses. Results: The optimal cut-off score for the ACE-R for detecting MCI, AD, and FTLD was 86/87, 82/83 and 83/84, respectively. ACE-R was superior to MMSE only in the detection of patients with FTLD area under the curve (AUC): 0.97 vs. 0.92], whilst the accuracy of the two instruments did not differ in identifying MCI and AD. The ratio of the scores of the memory ACE-R subtest to verbal fluency subtest contributed significantly to the discrimination between AD and FTLD (optimal cut-off score: 2.30/2.31, AUC: 0.77), whereas the MMSE and ACE-R total scores did not. Conclusion: The German ACE-R is superior to the most commonly employed MMSE in detecting mild dementia in FTLD and in the differential diagnosis between AD and FTLD. Thus it might serve as a valuable instrument as part of a comprehensive diagnostic workup in specialist centres/clinics contributing to the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of the cause of dementia.

The study refers to 50 patients with mild dementia of AD, 26 patients with mild dementia of vascular etiology and to 54 cognitively normal subjects. The ACE and MMSE were validated against an expert diagnosis based on a comprehensive diagnostic workup. Statistical analysis was performed using the receiver operator characteristics method. The optimal cut-off score for the ACE for detecting dementia in patients with early AD was 85/86, which had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 86%. The optimal cut-off for the ACE for the identification of dementia in patients with mild VaD was also 85/86 and it had a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 100%. The kappa values imply a substantial agreement between the diagnoses made by the ACE and the MMSE. The German version of the ACE is a short and practical but accurate test battery for the identification of AD and VaD, assessing a broad range of cognitive functions and providing a wide profile of cognitive functions/dysfunctions.

Perception of worsening health predicts mortality in older men: The Health in Men Study (HIMS)	Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics	Arch.Gerontol.Geriatr.	2012	Sep	 	55	2	363	368	mortality;older men;health impairments;social support;risk factors;Age Factors;Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Depression;Health Status;Humans;Male;Pain;Perception;Prevalence;Prospective Studies;Self Concept;Self Report;Sensation Disorders;Western Australia;Death and Dying;Aging	The main purpose of this study was to determine the most robust predictor of mortality among global self-rated health (SRH), time-comparative SRH or a combination of both measures. We also sought to determine factors associated with global SRH and time-comparative SRH measures. A prospective cohort study of 5583 community-dwelling older men aged 70 years or over living in Perth, Western Australia, was used. Older age, depressive symptoms, low social support, sensory impairment, presence of pain, and high Charlson score index were associated with both SRH measures. Global and time-comparative SRH were independent predictors of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, HR = 1.24 vs. 1.41 respectively); and the risk of death was almost doubled in those with both negative global SRH and perception of worsening health over the preceding 12 months (adjusted HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.58–2.47). In this group, the rate of death was especially high during the initial four years of follow up. We concluded that the two measures of SRH are likely to reflect the same domains of health, and the simultaneous use of both measures is the best predictor of short to medium term mortality.

Method(s): A total of 100 patients with persistent PTH attributed to mild TBI and 100 age- and gender-matched healthy controls free of mild TBI were enrolled between July 2018 and June 2019. Quality of sleep was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, while symptoms of anxiety and depression were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Cognitive impairment was evaluated using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment questionnaire, while post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was assessed using the Harvard Trauma Questionnaire. Result(s): In 100 patients with persistent PTH, 85% reported poor quality sleep, compared with 42% of healthy controls (P < 0.01). The relative frequency of probable to high risk of anxiety was 52% in the persistent PTH group vs. 8% in healthy controls (P < 0.01), while the relative frequency of probable to high risk of depression was 42% in the persistent PTH group vs. 2% in healthy controls (P < 0.01). Furthermore, 27% of the patients with persistent PTH had mild cognitive impairment while 10% had probable PTSD. Conclusion(s): Poor quality of sleep as well as symptoms suggestive of anxiety and depression were more common in patients with persistent PTH than healthy controls. Clinicians should screen patients with persistent PTH for these comorbidities and develop treatment plans that account for their presence.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s).

In a single-dose (25 mug/m2) randomized double-blind Phase IIa clinical trial, bryostatin levels reached a maximum at 1-2 h after the start of infusion. In close parallel with peak blood levels of bryostatin, an increase of PBMC PKC was measured (p = 0.0185) within 1 h from the onset of infusion. Of 9 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AD, of which 6 received drug and 3 received vehicle within a double-blind protocol, bryostatin increased the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score by 1.83+/-0.70 unit at 3 h versus -1.00+/-1.53 unit for placebo. Bryostatin was well tolerated in these AD patients and no drug-related adverse events were reported. The 25 mug/m2 administered dose was based on prior clinical experience with three Expanded Access advanced AD patients treated with bryostatin, in which return of major functions such as swallowing, vocalization, and word recognition were noted. In one Expanded Access patient trial, elevated PKC levels closely tracked cognitive benefits in the first 24 weeks as measured by MMSE and ADCS-ADL psychometrics. Pre-clinical mouse studies showed effective activation of PKC and increased levels of BDNF and PSD-95. Together, these Phase IIa, Expanded Access, and pre-clinical results provide initial encouragement for bryostatin 1 as a potential treatment for AD.Copyright © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

PD patients suffer from motor and non-motor symptoms, including disrupted sleep, pain, cognitive changes, and fatigue. These are known to significantly affect quality of life and can be difficult to treat. Mindfulness involves "the awareness that emerges through paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally to the unfolding of experience. 1]" Mindful practice may be beneficial in coping with psychological and physical conditions related to brain function, including depression, anxiety, and chronic pain 2]. Mindfulness meditation may also slow disease progression and improve quality of life in heart disease 3] and cancer 4]. A connection between mindfulness and PD has not yet been explored, though benefits in patients with chronic disease suggest that it may be a novel intervention for patients living with PD. Objective(s): We aim to determine the impact of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) on specific, clinically meaningful endpoints in patients with Parkinson's disease. Method(s): We collaborated with Duke Integrative Medicine to create a MBSR course for individuals with PD. 15 Duke patients completed the study. Selection criteria included: 1) Hoehn & Yahr stage <2.5, 2) MOCA score of = 26, 3) willingness and ability to complete training, and 4) no recent mental health crises. Participants completed quality of life surveys and a qualitative interview prior to, just following, and three months following course completion. The UPDRS was completed in the pre and post assessments. This study design was approved by the Duke University Health System IRB. Financial support was provided by the Parkinson's Foundation. Result(s): Study activities have been completed and data has been collected. Data analysis is pending at this time. Conclusion(s): Once analyzed, the collected data may support MBSR as a valid, non-pharmacological intervention that improves quality of life for people with Parkinson's disease.

Design and Methods: We conducted a two-group secondary data analysis of prospective observational data from 10 nursing homes in Birmingham, Alabama. By means of chart review, resident assessments, surveys of certified nursing assistants, and direct observation of residents' daily behaviors and environment, 32 residents (87.34 +/- 7.29 years) with a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score = 4.31 (+/-5.54) who died were compared with 32 residents (84 +/- 6.96 years) with a mean MMSE score = 4.28 (+/-5.49) who did not die during the clinical trial. Result(s): Residents who died displayed more verbal agitation, less time in verbal interaction with staff, and almost twice as much time restrained in bed during observation time in comparison with residents who did not die during the clinical trial. However, groups did not differ significantly in severity of comorbid illness, functional status, number of painful diagnoses, certified nursing assistants' reports of residents' pain, or opioid or nonopioid analgesic prescription or dosage. Surviving residents were more likely to receive neuroleptic medication than residents who died. Implications: Results suggest that agitated nursing home residents may exhibit a heightened level of verbal agitation, decreased verbal interaction with staff, and increased bed restraint up to 3 months prior to death. Prospective observational studies are needed to identify markers for imminent mortality among nursing home residents. Copyright 2005 by The Gerontological Society of America.

A particularly neglected area of palliative caregiving involves the lesbian, gay, bisexual transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) community. This chapter presents information regarding the characteristics of caregivers and care recipients in need of palliative and hospice care resulting from the progression of a variety of chronic illnesses and/or multimorbidity. We highlight disparities in receipt of such care among racial/ethnic and sexual minorities. Given that most of the literature concerning sexual and gender-variant elders and their caregivers is focused on HIV/AIDS, our focus is other LGBTQ issues in palliative caregiving. Evidence regarding the efficacy of interventions targeting palliative caregivers are reviewed thoroughly and illustrated with two case examples. We then describe research efforts to translate palliative caregiver interventions for use in primary care and community settings. We also provide a table of evidence that supports the efficacy of community-based interventions to reduce the suffering of palliative caregivers.

However, the relationship of multimorbidity with symptom burden and life-space is unclear. Method(s): We recruited community-dwelling older adults aged 75 years and older between 2010 and 2011 for the UAB Study of Aging II. Baseline assessments included age, sex, race, transportation difficulties, self-reported medical history, life-space mobility, symptoms known to be predictive of life-space, depressive symptoms (Geriatric Depression Scale), and cognition (Mini-Mental State Examination). Six diagnoses predictive of life-space (heart failure, diabetes, kidney disease, stroke, digestive disease, and arthritis) were coded as present/absent and summed to create a multimorbidity index. Ten symptoms (problems with balance, lack of energy, lower extremity pain, shortness of breath when walking, stiffness, tired/fatigued, swelling, tingling/burning, numbness, or weakness in legs or feet) were coded as present/absent, or rated in severity from 0 (none) to 3 (severe), and summed to develop the ASI and ASI-S respectively. Multivariate linear regression was used to evaluate the associations with life-space. Result(s): Participants (N=399; mean (SD) age = 81.7 (54.8); 58% ; 34% African American) had a mean life-space = 65.1 (25.0), mean ASI=3.6 (2.9), and mean ASI-S=5.8 (5.5). Comorbidity prevalences were 6% for heart failure, kidney disease, and ; 28% for ; 34% for digestive disease; and 63% for arthritis. Symptom prevalences ranged from 24% for shortness of breath to 65% for pain. Multimorbidity was associated with symptom burden (F(5,393)=8.99, p 0.92). The ASI/ASI-S continued to show a significant association with life-space after adjusting for other predictors (p < 0.001). Conclusion(s): Multimorbidity was associated with symptom burden, but not with community mobility. In contrast, ambulatory symptoms, as measured by the ASI & ASI-S, were strongly associated with lower life-space levels in late life.

Depression is highly prevalent in chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) patients attending the clinical settings. Cognitive impairment and neuroendocrine dysregulation had been reported in patients with depression and patients with CTTH. Objective(s): To assess the cognitive performance and investigate its possible relations to neuroendocrine levels in patients with CTTH. Subjects and methods: Patients with CTTH, depression, and control subjects were recruited. CTTH was diagnosed according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Cognitive performance, depression severity, and pain intensity were assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Arabic version, Beck's Depression Inventory, and McGill Pain Questionnaire respectively. Blood samples were collected in the morning within 60 min after waking up from 8:00 to 9:00 a.m. to measure serum levels of basal plasma CRH, ACTH, Cortisol, TSH, FT3, and FT4. Result(s): Both patients with CTTH and depression had impaired cognitive performance. Patients with CTTH and patients with depression had altered the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis, and pituitary-thyroid axis. The hormonal levels significantly correlated with cognitive function in patient groups, especially patients with CTTH. Conclusion(s): Patients with CTTH had cognitive dysfunction which could be related to neuroendocrine hormonal dysregulation.Copyright © 2020, The Author(s).

However, few studies have been conducted assessing the Portuguese version of this test in Brazil (MOCA-BR). Objective: the aim of the present study was to define the cut-off points of the MOCA-BR scale for diagnosing Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) and Dementia (PD-D) in patients with PD. Methods: this was a cross-sectional, analytic field study based on a quantitative approach. Patients were selected after a consecutive assessment by a neurologist, after an extensive cognitive evaluation, and were classified as having normal cognition (PD-N), PD-MCI or PD-D. The MOCA-BR was then applied and 89 patients selected. Results: on the cognitive assessment, 30.3% were PD-N, 41.6% PD-MCI and 28.1% PD-D. The cut-off score on the MOCABr to distinguish PD-N from PD-D was 22.50 (95% CI 0.748-0.943) for sensitivity of 85.5% and specificity of 71.1%. The cut-off for distinguishing PD-D from MCI was 17.50 (95% CI 0.758-0.951) for sensitivity of 81.6% and specificity of 76%.

This hypothesis has been tested in patients with AD using encapsulated cell biodelivery of NGF (NGF-ECB) in a first-in-human study. We report our results from a third-dose cohort of patients receiving second-generation NGF-ECB implants with improved NGF secretion. Method(s): Four patients with mild to moderate AD were recruited to participate in an open-label, phase Ib dose escalation study with a 6-month duration. Each patient underwent stereotactic implant surgery with four NGF-ECB implants targeted at the cholinergic basal forebrain. The NGF secretion of the second-generation implants was improved by using the Sleeping Beauty transposon gene expression technology and an improved three-dimensional internal scaffolding, resulting in production of about 10 ng NGF/device/day. Result(s): All patients underwent successful implant procedures without complications, and all patients completed the study, including implant removal after 6 months. Upon removal, 13 of 16 implants released NGF, 8 implants released NGF at the same rate or higher than before the implant procedure, and 3 implants failed to release detectable amounts of NGF. Of 16 adverse events, none was NGF-, or implant-related. Changes from baseline values of cholinergic markers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlated with cortical nicotinic receptor expression and Mini Mental State Examination score. Levels of neurofilament light chain (NFL) protein increased in CSF after NGF-ECB implant, while glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) remained stable. Conclusion(s): The data derived from this patient cohort demonstrate the safety and tolerability of sustained NGF release by a second-generation NGF-ECB implant to the basal forebrain, with uneventful surgical implant and removal of NGF-ECB implants in a new dosing cohort of four patients with AD.

All participants were assessed using the Arabic versions of the Tinetti assessment battery (TAB) for gait and balance, mini-mental state examination, and disability of arm, shoulder, and hand assessment test. Result(s): A total of 221 nursing home residents were included in this study. Different chronic diseases were medically reported in this study. Psychiatric disorders (45.7%) were shown to be the most prevalent disease seen among the participants, followed by hypertension and diabetes mellitus affecting 33.5% and 23.5% of the participants, respectively. However, the least prevalent diseases were stroke (17.2%), joint inflammation (17.2%), and arthritis (9.0%). Based on TAB scores, the participants were classified into three groups: high risk of falls (=24; n=80). The correlation between physical activity and mental health problems with risks of falls was reported in all participants. The data showed that participants with over 50% upper extremity disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension recorded higher risks of falls as measured by TAB test compared to those with low and moderate TAB scores. Also, impairment in cognitive abilities and psychiatric disorders was shown to be associated with gait and balance problems, with a higher risk of falls in 47.5% and 46.1% of the residents, respectively. Conclusion(s): This study revealed a significant impact of upper limb disability, stroke, heart disease, arthritis, joint diseases, diabetes, and hypertension as well as psychiatric disorders and cognitive disabilities on gait and balance deficits among home-resident older adults.Copyright © 2016 Al-Momani et al.

A subset of patients with schizophrenia and DefSCZ experience physiosomatic symptoms reminiscent of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. However, there are no data whether, in DefSCZ, physiosomatic symptoms are associated with increased levels of cytokines/chemokines. This study examined the associations between physiosomatic symptoms, as assessed with the FibroFatigue (FF) scale, and symptoms of DefSCZ as well as interleukin IL-1β, IL-1 receptor antagonist (sIL-1RA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and CCL11 (eotaxin) in 120 DefSCZ patients (as defined by the Schedule for Deficit Schizophrenia) and 54 healthy controls. In DefSCZ, there were robust associations between FF and negative symptoms, psychosis, hostility, excitation, mannerism, psychomotor retardation and formal thought disorders. A latent vector extracted from those DefSCZ symptom domains also loaded highly on the total FF score and showed adequate convergent validity, internal consistency reliability and predictive relevance. The FF score was significantly associated with impairments in semantic and episodic memory and executive functions. Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogy showed that the FF items discriminated DefSCZ from controls with an 100% accuracy. Interleukin IL-1β, IL-1RA, TNF-α and CCL11 explained 59.4% of the variance in the LV extracted from the FF and DefSCZ symptoms. In conclusion, these data show that physiosomatic symptoms are a core component of DefSCZ phenomenology and are strongly associated with activated immune pathways, which have neurotoxic effects.

Non- and partial responders had lower posttreatment MMSE scores than responders, men had lower posttreatment scores than women, and Ss over 50 yrs old had lower pretreatment scores than younger Ss, although in all cases, the magnitude of the differences was small and unlikely to be clinically important. Results suggest the MMSE is not a sensitive indicator of depression severity, concentration problems, or likelihood of treatment response among healthy adults with major depression.

Our secondary aim was to determine drug-related side effects.; Design: This was a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.; Settings: The study was carried out in the setting of the operating room and the surgical ward.; Patients: Ninety-four patients, 18 to 65 years of age, ASA status I-II, scheduled for elective repair of lumbar disc herniation were enrolled in the study.; Interventions: The patients were randomly divided into 3 groups: the first group received pregabalin 75 mg orally 1 hour before the surgery and at the postoperative 12th and 24th hours. The second group received duloxetine 60 mg orally 1 hour before the surgery. At the postoperative 12th hour, they received a placebo capsule, and, at the 24th hour, they received duloxetine 60 mg again. The third group received placebo capsules orally at all timepoints.; Measurements: Postoperative pain evaluation was conducted using a Visual Analogue Scale at the postoperative first minute, 30th minute, first hour, and the 12th, 24th, and 48th hours. The preoperative and postoperative sixth hour cognitive functions were evaluated with Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test.; Main Results: There was a significant reduction in mean MoCA scores postoperatively in all groups (P<0.01). The highest MoCA score reduction was in the pregabalin group (1.83±1.31 point), then in the duloxetine group (1.16±0.82), and the least decrease was in the control group (0.49±0.61). At all timepoints, the mean Visual Analogue Scale scores of the pregabalin and duloxetine groups were similar to each other, and they were lower than that of the control group (P<0.05).; Conclusions: Preoperative use of duloxetine 60 mg can be an useful alternative to pregabalin 75 mg, as it has a similar analgesic effect on postoperative pain, with fewer incidences of drug-related negative effects on cognitive function.

In this study, we aimed to assess the silent neurological manifestations, behavioral and neuropsychiological impairments of Behçet’s disease patients with ocular involvement. Methods: Thirty BD patients with ocular involvement in the nonactive phase of their illness were applied detailed neurological examination and magnetic resonance imagining (MRI). Neuropsychological tests were performed. Patients’ neuropsychological performances were compared to those of healthy, demographically matched twenty subjects. Results: Neurological manifestations of patients were headache (56.6%), pyramidal signs (13.3%), behavioral changes (3.3%) and sensory symptoms (3.3%). Four patients (13.3%) had white matter hyperintensities lesions on T2/FLAIR brain MRI. Fourteen patients (46%) had impaired cognitive performances on the following tasks: verbal memory (immediate memory p = 0.000, maximal learning capacity p = 0.009, number of repetitions p = 0.000, total learning capacity p = 0.001, recall p = 0.033), nonverbal memory (immediate memory p = 0.029, recall p = 0.001), logical memory (immediate memory p = 0.001, recall p = 0.001), executive (frontal) functions (clock-drawing test p = 0.000, Stroop test p = 0.001, verbal fluency tests p = 0.000). Patients’ MMSE and clock drawing test scores were significantly lower than controls (p = 0.03). Attention deficit was not detected. Behçet’s disease patients showed higher scores on depression scales than healthy subjects but there was no statistically significant difference between anxiety scores. Conclusion: Neuropsychological deficits, involving mainly memory and executive functioning, subcortical MRI lesions, and non-structural headache may be present in Behçet’s disease patients with ocular involvement without overt neurological manifestations.

We compared the safety and efficacy of the neurotrophic compound Cerebrolysin (10 ml; n=64), donepezil (10 mg; n=66) and a combination of both treatments (n=67) in mild-to-moderate (mini-mental state examination-MMSE score 12-25) probable AD patients enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial. Primary end-points were global outcome (Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change plus caregiver input; CIBIC+) and cognition (change from baseline in AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale+; ADAS-cog+) at week 28. Changes in functioning (AD Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living scale, ADCS-ADL) and behaviour (Neuropsychiatric Inventory, NPI) were secondary endpoints. Treatment effects in cognitive, functional and behavioral domains showed no significant group differences; whereas improvements in global outcome favored Cerebrolysin and the combination therapy. Cognitive performance improved in all treatment groups (mean+/-SD for Cerebrolysin: -1.7+/-7.5; donepezil: -1.2+/-6.1; combination: -2.3+/-6.0) with best scores in the combined therapy group at all study visits. Cerebrolysin was as effective as donepezil, and the combination of neurotrophic (Cerebrolysin) and cholinergic (donepezil) treatment was safe in mild-to-moderate AD. The convenience of exploring long-term synergistic effects of this combined therapy is suggested. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

Extraarticular manifestations of RA can occur in about 40% of patients, either in the beginning or during the course of their disease. Recent studies have suggested that RA may have an important relation in the development of cognitive and neurological dysfunction. However, the bond between RA and the brain is still uncertain. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency and the clinical predictors of cognitive impairment in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Method(s): A cross-sectional and case-control study was performed including consecutive RA patients seen in a rheumatology outpatient clinic of referral tertiary hospital. The control group included 100 healthy subjects. We registered clinical and demographic data including age, sex, level of education, time of disease, time of diagnosis, drugs in use, cardiovascular risk factors and other comorbidities. Functional capacity was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ). Neurological appraisal was made with standardized questionnaires: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD). Analysis of the data was performed using qui-square and t-tests and a multivariate analysis (SPSS 22.0). Significance level was set as <0.05. Result(s): We included 200 patients (166 were female) with a mean age of 57.4 (+/-11.4) years; Among these patients, 163 (81.5%) used corticosteroids, 148 (74%) methotrexate, 16 (8%) sulfasalazine, 91 (45.5%) leflunomide, 35 (17.5%) chloroquine and 57 (28.5%) biologic therapy. The mean age of RA diagnosis was 43.0 (+/-13.6) years. In both univariate and multivariate analysis, compared to the control group, patients with RA presented significant lower MMSE (21.9+/-3.9) and MoCA (17.0+/-4.4) scores (p<0.05). Adjusting for level of education, just 61 and 50 patients presented normal MMSE and MoCA scores (p<0.01), respectively. Cognitive decline was associated with higher HAQ scores (functional outcome due to RA) and prolonged time of disease (p<0.05). No correlation was found between sex, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein levels and the neurological impairment. The mean HAD score was 17.7 (+/-7.7) and anxiety and depression were more prevalent in RA p atients than in control group (p<0.01). Conclusion(s): Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may present with cognitive decline and dementia as extra-articular manifestations of the disease. Neurological impairment is usually disregarded and might be under-diagnosed in RA patients. Future studies are necessary in order to better understand the relationship between RA and the brain.

However, this common assumption is not clear in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PwPD) suffering from different postural deformities such as: Pisa syndrome (PS), Camptocormia & Antecollis (C&A). Objectives: to investigate the effect of different postural deformities including PS and C&A on neck function and pain in patient (PwPD). Methods: Forty-five participants belonging to three groups: 15 PD patients without postural disorders (PD), 15 with PS, and 15 with C&A. The function, disability and pain were assessed by Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) which used to assess the pain severity (BPI-PS) and Pain Interference (BPI-PI). All groups completed clinical assessments by the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Modified Hoenh & Yahr (mH&Y) staging and the Levodopa Equivalent Daily Dose (LEDD). Results: PD group compared with PS and C&A groups showed differences in NDI, BPI-PS, BPI-PI, LEDD and mH&Y staging (P < 0.001), but no differences found in PD duration, UPDRS-II and III in the same groups. Moreover, no differences were observed between PS and C&A groups in the mentioned scales. Discussion and Conclusion: These results demonstrated that PS and C&A are associated with severe impairment of neck functions, and pain in PwPD.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment after omission of hearing‐dependent subtests: Psychometrics and clinical recommendations	Journal of the American Geriatrics Society	J.Am.Geriatr.Soc.	2019	08	 	67	8	1689	1694	hearing loss;Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA);cognitive screening;psychometrics;delayed recall;Cognitive Assessment;Cognitive Impairment;Hearing Disorders;Screening Tests;Alzheimer's Disease;Test Sensitivity;Test Specificity	Objectives: Hearing loss (HL) is the third most common chronic health condition in older adults, yet it is often undiagnosed and/or untreated. Given the association between HL and cognitive impairment, it is expected that many people undergoing cognitive screening may have HL. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief screening test that assesses a wide range of cognitive functions sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Although MoCA items were carefully designed to be sensitive to deficits in MCI, they were not designed to take sensory declines into account. In the current investigation, we examined the MoCA's psychometric properties following omission of subtests primarily dependent on hearing status (memory, digit span, attention to letters, and sentence repetition). Design: Cross‐sectional analytic design (retrospective analysis). Setting: We used the original MoCA validation study data. Participants: Groups consisted of healthy controls (N = 90), subjects with MCI (N = 94), and subjects with mild AD (N = 93). Measurements: We assessed sensitivity and specificity using absolute and proportional cutoff score adjustments. We developed receiver operating characteristics curves to determine the best cutoff values for both MCI and AD patients using different combinations of auditory subtest omissions. Results: Compared with the original MoCA (MCI sensitivity = 90%; specificity = 87%), MCI sensitivity was substantially reduced (absolute scoring = 43%; proportional scoring = 56%) when all auditory subtests were omitted, with the biggest contribution to the reduction coming from the delayed recall subtest. Excluding three subtests and maintaining the delayed recall had no effect on MCI sensitivity but reduced specificity (sensitivity = 94%, specificity: 71% using proportional scoring). AD sensitivity, in contrast, was not strongly influenced by our manipulation and remained relatively high through all three subtest omission combinations. Conclusion: The current study highlights the contribution of hearing‐dependent subtests on the sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA. Clinical recommendations related to these findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)	ID: 2019-46256-022; Accession Number: 2019-46256-022.

Background: The ACE-R is a brief cognitive battery that assesses various aspects of cognition. Its 5 subdomains (Attention and Orientation, Memory, Verbal Fluency, Language, and Visuospatial Abilities) are commonly impaired in Alzheimer disease or frontotemporal dementia. Methods: We evaluated 144 cognitively healthy volunteers (50% men, 50% women) aged 50 to 93 years, with 4 to 24 years of schooling. We divided the participants into 4 age groups, each of which was then stratified into 3 groups according to years of education. We assessed all participants with the ACE-R, the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale, and the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Results: Years of education affected all ACE-R subscores. Age influenced the Verbal Fluency subscore (P  0.05). Conclusions: The performance of healthy middle-aged and elderly individuals on the ACE-R battery is strongly influenced by education and, to a lesser extent, by age. These findings are of special relevance in countries with populations that have marked heterogeneity in educational levels.

As a complex pathology, at all stages of CKD patients need to have a good understanding of the need for drug and nutritional adherence. Cognitive screening is the starting point for detection of cognitive impairments. Objective: To determine the specificity and sensitivity of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment – Basic (MoCA-B) for identification of cognitive impairment in the CKD population. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study with 163 CKD patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and MoCA-B were administered. Results: The MoCA-B has reliable internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.74). A cutoff point of ≤ 21 points provides the best sensitivity and specificity for detection of cognitive impairment. The education variable had less impact on the total MoCA-B score than on the total MMSE score. Conclusions: The MoCA-B is a suitable screening instrument for evaluating the global cognition of hemodialysis patients. The results can help health professionals to conduct evaluations and plan clinical management. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved); Introdução: O comprometimento cognitivo na doença renal crônica (DRC) é comumente associado a distúrbios neuropsiquiátricos. Sendo uma patologia complexa, a DRC, em qualquer estágio, requer que o paciente tenha uma boa compreensão da necessidade de adesão ao medicamento e à nutrição. A triagem cognitiva é o ponto de partida para a detecção de deficiências cognitivas. Objetivo: Determinar a especificidade e a sensibilidade da versão em português do Brasil do Montreal Cognitive Assessment – Basic (MoCA-B) para identificação de comprometimento cognitivo na população com DRC. Métodos: Este foi um estudo transversal com 163 pacientes com DRC em tratamento hemodialítico. Foram aplicados o Mini Exame do Estado Mental (MEEM) e o MoCA-B. Resultados: O MoCA-B obteve consistência interna confiável (alfa de Cronbach = 0,74). Um ponto de corte de ≤ 21 pontos fornece a melhor sensibilidade e especificidade para a detecção de comprometimento cognitivo. A variável educação teve menos impacto no escore total do MoCA-B do que no escore total do MEEM. Conclusões: O MoCA-B é um instrumento de triagem adequado para avaliar a cognição global de pacientes em hemodiálise. Os resultados podem ajudar os profissionais de saúde a realizar avaliações e planejar o manejo clínico.

Program Description: The patient who was on chronic immune suppression with tacrolimus and prednisone was admitted with a 3-day history of headache, myalgias, and 102degreeF fevers. She deteriorated rapidly and required mechanical ventilation. Her cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed positive West Nile virus immunoglobin G but negative immunoglobin M. Cerebrospinal fluid realtime polymerase chain reaction detected West Nile virus RNA. Computed tomography of the head showed hemorrhage in the right thalamic and right superior cerebellar region. She was diagnosed with West Nile encephalitis and remained in a comatose state for almost 3 months. She was transferred to an acute rehabilitation unit when her mental status improved to opening eyes to commands. On admission, she had severe dysarthria, head titubation, both horizontal and vertical nystagmus, generalized coarse tremor, dysmetria, and dysdiadochokinesia. As a result, she was unable to read, write, sit, stand and was dependent for all her basic activities of daily living. Setting(s): A tertiary care hospital. Result(s): After 3 weeks of intense rehabilitation, she was able to read and write, and had a Mini-Mental State Examination improved to 26 of 30. Although her cerebellar dysfunction persisted, she improved sufficiently to require only minimal assistance in basic activities of daily living, transferring, and ambulation. Discussion(s): This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of the rehabilitation of a survivor of West Nile encephalitis who presented with profound cerebellar and cognitive dysfunction. Chronic immunosuppression, required to maintain allograft function after organ transplantation, predisposes patients with transplantation to a variety of viral infections, including West Nile virus infection, which can occur at every stage after transplantation. Conclusion(s): This case demonstrates the importance of rehabilitation in the long-term functional and cognitive recovery of survivors of West Nile encephalitis.

There is insufficient clinical evidence for suffering in dying dementia patients, which may lead to inappropriate evaluation and insufficient palliative treatment. Our objective was to evaluate the suffering of terminal dementia patients over time, from admission to a geriatric ward to the last day of life. The study included consecutive end-stage dementia patients dying in a general geriatric department of a tertiary hospital. Patients were evaluated weekly by the Mini Suffering State Examination scale (MSSE). Seventy-one patients were studied. Mean survival of patients was 38.0±5.1 days. MSSE increased during hospital stays from 5.62±2.31 to 6.89±1.95 (p<0.001). According to the MSSE scale, 63.4 percent and 29.6 percent of patients died with a high and intermediate level of suffering, respectively. Only 7 percent of the patients died with a low level of suffering. In particular, patients were restless (p<0.001), had pressure sores (p=0.01), and were considered medically unstable (p<0.001). We concluded that, despite traditional medical and nursing care, a large proportion of dying dementia patients experienced an increasing amount of suffering as they approached death. New palliative treatment approaches should be developed for these patients. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)	ID: 2004-17767-007; Accession Number: 2004-17767-007.

Aim(s): To assess the prevalence, pattern and correlates of psychiatric morbidity among community dwelling elderly persons (>= 60 years) in Abeokuta, Nigeria. Method(s): 532 respondents were selected using a multistage, stratified cluster sampling method from the elderly population in Abeokuta. First, participants were administered the socio-demographic questionnaire, General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Those with a score of >= 3 in GHQ-12 were assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI PLUS), while those with = 80 years), having a chronic medical illness and bereavement in the last 1 year were most significantly associated with having mental health problems. Conclusion(s): A significant number of the elderly population in the studied community suffers from a psychiatric illness. It is hoped that studies as these will inform stakeholders on the need to pay closer attention to the mental health needs of the elderly, as their overall wellbeing plays a role in determining the overall health of the community.Copyright © The Author(s) 2020.

We aimed to explore the cognition level in patients of all severities with different lesion sites and the effect of demographic variables, lesion site, TBI severity, and the time since the TBI on their cognitive abilities using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Basic (MoCA-B). A total of 67 patients with TBI were recruited from the Department of Cerebral Surgery at No. 101 Hospital of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at out-patient follow up. A regression model was performed to assess the effect of these variables on cognition of TBI patients. As expected, age, education, and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were found as predictors of cognition of TBI patients. Participants, who were younger, had more years of education, and a higher GCS score had better cognition, respectively. Thus, the results provide evidence for the early detection of possible different cognition impairment of TBI patients. Specifically, these findings can help predict early prognosis for patients in the course of clinical diagnosis and treatment and, thus, allow for early intervention to improve the patients’ quality of life and possible extend their life.

The study design was a cross sectional observational case control study. The study site was carried out in the department of general medicine at Vivekanandha medical care Hospital, Tiruchengode. Patients of subclinical hypothyroidism without neurological disorder, Patients of overt hypothyroidism without neurological disorder, Normal Euthyroid persons were included in the study, Pediatrics Patients, Comatose patients, Chronic Illness patients, Patients with neurological disorder, pregnant women were excluded from the study. The average MMSE score of hypothyroid patients was 22.56+/-3.36, average MMSE score of control group is 24.94+/-2.48. When compared the both group shows (p <0.0001) extremely significant. Hypothyroidism patients have low MMSE score than euthyroid participants which reveals hypothyroidism is significantly associated with cognitive impairment. Present study also reveals patients who have chronic thyroid damage leads to higher risk of cognitive impairment.Copyright © 2019, Research Journal of Pharmacy and Technology. All rights reserved.

Stimulation therapy, including physical exercise and cholinesterase inhibitors are both reported to postpone cognitive deterioration in separate studies. We aimed to study the effect of stimulation therapy and the additional effect of donepezil on cognitive function in early AD. Method(s): Design: A two-by-two factorial trial comprising stimulation therapy for one year compared to standard care to which a randomized double-blinded placebo controlled trial with donepezil was added. Setting(s): Nine rural municipalities in Northern Norway. Participant(s): 187 participants 65 years and older with a recent diagnosis of mild or moderate AD were included in the study of which 146 completed a one-year follow-up. INTERVENTIONS: In five municipalities the participants received stimulation therapy whereas participants in four received standard care. All participants were randomised double-blindly to donepezil or placebo and tested with three different cognitive tests four times during the one-year study period.Main outcome: Changes in MMSE sum score.Secondary outcome: Changes in ADAS-Cog and Clock Drawing Test. Result(s): MMSE scores remained unchanged amongst AD participants receiving stimulation therapy and those receiving standard care. The results were consistent for ADAS-Cog and Clock Drawing Test. No time trend differences were found during one-year follow-up between groups receiving stimulation therapy versus standard care or between donepezil versus placebo. Conclusion(s): In rural AD patients non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapy did not improve outcome compared with standard care but all groups retained cognitive function during one year follow-up. Other studies are needed to confirm these results.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (Identifier: NCT00443014).

Preliminary evidence suggests that administering the glutamate antagonist ketamine with ECT might alleviate cognitive adverse effects and accelerate symptomatic improvement; we tested this in a randomised trial of low-dose ketamine. Methods In this multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study in 11 ECT suites serving inpatient and outpatient care settings in seven National Health Service trusts in the North of England, we recruited severely depressed patients, who were diagnosed as having unipolar or bipolar depressive episodes defined as moderate or severe by DSM-IV criteria, aged at least 18 years, and were able and willing to provide written consent to participate in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to ketamine (0.5 mg/kg intravenous bolus) or saline adjunctive to the anaesthetic for the duration of their ECT course. Patients and assessment and ECT treatment teams were masked to treatment allocation, although anaesthetists administering the study medication were not. We analysed the primary outcome, Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised delayed verbal recall (HVLT-R-DR) after four ECT treatments, using a Gaussian repeated measures model in all patients receiving the first ECT treatment. In the same population, safety was assessed by adverse effect monitoring. This trial was registered with International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Number, number ISRCTN14689382. Findings Between early December, 2012, and mid-June, 2015, 628 patients were screened for eligibility, of whom 79 were randomly assigned to treatment (40 in the ketamine group vs 39 in the saline group). Ketamine (mean 5.17, SD 2.92), when compared with saline (5.54, 3.42), had no benefit on the primary outcome (HVLT-R-DR; difference in means -0.43 95% CI -1.73 to 0.87]). 15 (45%) of 33 ketamine-treated patients compared with 10 (27%) of 37 patients receiving saline experienced at least one adverse event which included two (6%) of 33 patients who had ketamine-attributable transient psychological effects. Psychiatric adverse events were the most common in both groups (six 27%] of 22 adverse events in the ketamine group vs seven 54%] of 13 in the saline group). Interpretation No evidence of benefit for ketamine was found although the sample size used was small; however, the results excluded greater than a small to moderate benefit with 95% confidence. The results do not support the use of adjunctive low-dose ketamine in routine ECT treatment.

Methods: The sociodemographic profiles and MMSE scores of adults aged 65-years and over who participated in the Australian National Mental Health and Well-being Survey were assessed (N=1,792). Results: The regression models showed that older age, education levels, language spoken at home and in country of birth, socioeconomic status (SES), occupation, sex, and presence of a mood disorder made significant and unique contributions to performance on the MMSE. The individual (univariate) influence of each factor ranged from -2.61 to 0.09 points, with non- English speaking background (NESB) making the biggest impact. Based on a MMSE score of ≤23 points, 7.7% of the Australian elderly population screened positive for cognitive impairment that may be indicative of dementia. In those scoring ≤23 points, the multivariate model accounted for 24.61% of the variance. Conclusion: Many sociodemographic variables and the presence of a mood disorder influence MMSE performance. Using conventional cutoff scores for screening will lead to a high rate of false positives in older adults (75+ years), those with NESB, and those with low SES, and is insensitive for those with high education. The authors suggest simple rules for the correction of the impact of these variables.

The present study investigated auto-biographical memories in 19 tinnitus patients and 19 controls without tinnitus. Participants were administered the autobiographical memory test (AMT), the Controlled word association test, and self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and tinnitus distress. Compared to control participants, tinnitus patients had difficulty retrieving specific memories and showed longer retrieval latencies. Additionally, tinnitus patients had fewer specific memories to positive cue words. While AMT responses were associated with depression scores, the difference between controls and patients remained significant for positive cue words after controlling for depression scores. Results suggest that cognitive components should be an integral element of the psychological management of tinnitus. The use in future studies of experimental methods such as AMT in health psychology is encouraged.

The DOLOPLUS-2 is a behavioral pain assessment scale for the elderly with impaired verbal communication. It rates five somatic items, two psychomotor items, and three psychosocial items as indicators of pain. The aims of the present study were to develop a Japanese version of the DOLOPLUS-2 and to apply it to elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: The translated instrument was evaluated with reference to Japanese patients with AD experiencing pain during post-surgery rehabilitation for hip fractures and who were unable to use any self-reported pain measures. After translation and back-translation, 21 registered nurses tested ‘Version 1’ of the pain assessment scale on three patients. The ratings of the nurses and researcher were compared and the number of matching scores determined. Semistructured interviews were conducted with the nurses and patient case studies were recorded. The results of the interviews provided the basis for the development of ‘Version 2’ of the scale, which was then tested with six patients and 31 nurses using the same procedures as for the testing of Version 1. Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-rater reliability for the Version 2 administrators was 0.90 (P < 0.001), with a 95% confidence interval of 0.88–0.92; the degree of agreement by items (0.67–0.90) was excellent. Nurses' comments for Version 1 revealed that it was ‘difficult to use’ and that ‘some Japanese expressions and explanations needed improvement’. In contrast, the nurses' comments on Version 2 indicated that there were no problems. Analysis of patient case studies in Version 2 indicated that pain scores were high only when the patients clearly would have had pain, such as when they started with full weight bearing. On the basis of these results, we developed a final version of the Japanese DOLOPLUS-2. Conclusion: The findings of the present study suggest that Version 2 of the Japanese DOLOPLUS-2 can be used reliably in clinical settings to measure the pain AD patients may be experiencing. However, the final version of the Japanese DOLOPLUS-2 needs to be validated in a larger patient cohort in future studies.

However, there is currently no gold standard for its diagnosis. The aim of this observational cross-sectional study was to assess the neuropathic component of pain in various chronic low back pain syndromes using a range of diagnostic tests. Materials and Methods: Included in this study were 63 patients with chronic axial low back pain (ALBP), 48 patients with chronic radicular syndromes (CRS) comprising 23 with discogenic compression (CDRS) and 25 with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), and 74 controls. PainDETECT questionnaire (PDQ), quantitative sensory testing (QST), and skin biopsy with evaluation of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) were used to assess the neuropathic pain component. Results: Positive PDQ (≥ 19) was obtained more frequently in patients with CDRS and LSS (26.1% and 12.0%, respectively) compared with patients with ALBP (1.6%, P < 0.001). The proportion of patients with sensory loss confirmed by QST was lowest in the ALBP subgroup (23.8%) compared with CDRS (47.8%), and LSS (68.0%) subgroups (P < 0.001). A reduction in IENFD was disclosed in a proportion of up to 52.0% of affected roots in patients with CRS. Discussion: Neuropathic pain is quite frequent in CRS, and QST reveals sensory loss as a frequent abnormality in patients with CRS. Using a cut-off value of 19, PDQ identified a neuropathic component in a relatively low proportion of patients with CRS. CRS may be associated with a reduction in IENFD.

Methods: Data about age, gender, education, occupation, income, marital and residential status, social relations, disease duration, functional status, treatment and concomitant diseases were collected of 139 Greek patients (68 men and 71 women) with PD. Patients were consecutively recruited from the outpatient clinic of the first Neurology Department of Athens National University at Aeginition Hospital. Disease severity was assessed using the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale including Hoehn and Yahr and Schwab and England (S&E) scales. HRQoL was measured by the specific Parkinson's disease questionnaire (PDQ-39). A multivariate multiple regression model with normal errors was used for the statistical analysis. Results: The main determinants of HRQoL were low degree of independence measured by the S&E scale (F = 35.942, p < 0.001), social isolation (F = 20.508, p < 0.001), disease duration (F = 14.983, p < 0.001), sleep (F = 6.507, p = 0.013) and gastrointestinal disturbances (F = 4.643, p = 0.035) and the presence of depression (F = 6.022, p = 0.017). Conclusion: Among the other chronic comorbidities only depression was associated with a poor HRQoL in PD patients. Functional dependence and social isolation contributed most to worse HRQoL. Our findings suggest that adequate social support and management of depression, sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances could reduce the distress and improve HRQoL in patients with PD.

Also, oxymorphone and noroxymorphone contributions to analgesia and the adverse effects of oxycodone were assessed.; Methods: Four hundred fifty-six cancer patients receiving oxycodone for cancer pain were included. Pain was assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory. The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-C30 was used to assess the symptoms of tiredness, nausea, constipation, and depression. Cognitive function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination. Associations were examined by multiple linear or ordinal logistic regressions. Whether patients classified as being a "treatment success" or a "treatment failure" had different serum concentrations of oxycodone or metabolites was assessed using Mann-Whitney U-tests.; Results: Serum concentrations of oxycodone and metabolites were not associated with pain intensity, nausea, tiredness, or cognitive function, with the exception that increased pain intensity was associated with higher oxymorphone concentrations. Patients with poor pain control and side effects had higher serum concentrations of the oxycodone metabolites, noroxycodone and noroxymorphone, compared with those with good pain relief and without side effects.; Conclusion: This study of patients receiving oxycodone for cancer pain confirms previous observations that there is most likely no association between serum concentrations of opioid analgesics and clinical effects.

Research design: nursing home residents with 17 or more points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and >= 3 months residence (128 of 552 screened) were selected randomly. Interviewers administered the SF-36 (repeated after 1 week), Geriatric Depression Scale and MMSE. We recorded activities of daily living and medication data from medical records. Data analysis included test-retest intraclass correlations, item completion, score distributions and SF-36 correlations with measures of physical and mental functioning. Result(s): 97 nursing home residents (75.8%) consented. Test-retest intraclass correlation coefficients were good to excellent (range = 0.55 to 0.82). Convergent validity between SF-36 physical health scales and the activities of daily living index was modest (r range = -0.37 to -0.43). About 25% of residents scored zero (lowest score) on at least one SF-36 physical function measure. SF-36 mental health scales correlated strongly with the Geriatric Depression Scale (r range = -0.63 to -0.71) and modestly with bodily pain (r = -0.35). No SF-36 scales correlated strongly with the MMSE. Conclusion(s): only one in five nursing home residents met minimal participation criteria, suggesting limited utility of the SF-36 in nursing homes. Reliability and validity characteristics were fairly good. Skewed scores were noted for some SF-36 scales. The utility of the SF-36 may be limited to assessments of subjects with higher cognitive and physical functioning than typical nursing home residents. The SF-36 might benefit from modification for this setting, or by tests of proxy ratings.	ID: 29535335; M1: (Andresen, Gravitt) Department of Community Health, St. Louis Univ. Sch. of Pub.

Immune-inflammatory pathways and clinical changes in fibromyalgia patients treated with Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR): A randomized, controlled clinical trial	Brain, behavior, and immunity	Brain Behav.Immun.	2019	08	 	80	 	109	119	Fibromyalgia;Cytokines;Chemokines;Immune biomarkers;MBSR;Mindfulness;Interleukins;Mindfulness-Based Interventions;Biological Markers;Immune System;Stress Management	Fibromyalgia (FM) is a highly prevalent and disabling syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain and a broad range of cognitive and affective symptoms. Up to now, the pathogenesis of FM is unknown although a peripheral and central sensitization involving an imbalance on immune biomarkers appears to have a relevant role in its aetiology. The aim of this study was to extend previous clinical findings of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to both its impact on clinical symptomatology and immune biomarkers (IL-6, CXCL8, IL-10 and hs-CRP), and also to explore the role of biomarkers as predictors of efficacy. Methods: A total of 70 female patients with FM were randomly assigned to two treatment modalities, namely Treatment as Usual (TAU) plus MBSR (n = 35) or TAU alone (n = 35). This study is embedded within a larger RCT (n = 225) that includes three study arms (TAU; TAU plus MBSR; and TAU plus the psychoeducative intervention FibroQoL), and a 12-month follow-up (clinical trial registration: NCT02561416). Blood cytokine assays and clinical assessment were conducted at baseline and post-treatment. Treatment effects were analysed using linear mixed models with intention to treat and per protocol analyses. In order to evaluate the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, ratios of pro-inflammatory IL-6, CXCL8 and hs-CRP with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 were calculated (i.e. IL-6/IL-10, CXCL8/IL10 and hs-CRP/IL-10). Results: The results show that MBSR is an efficacious intervention to reduce clinical severity of patients with FM. MBSR also prevents the tendency of IL-10 to decrease as observed in the TAU group. Higher levels of baseline CXCL8 levels attenuate the beneficial effect of MBSR practice on clinical symptomatology, including pain, energy, stiffness or quality of sleep. Furthermore, higher baseline IL-6/IL-10 and CXCL8/IL-10 ratios were associated with less improvement in psychological inflexibility following MBSR treatment. Discussion: Our results show that mindfulness training has clinical efficacy in patients with FM. The results suggest that MBSR has significant immune regulatory effects in FM patients, while immune-inflammatory pathways may in part predict the clinical efficacy of MBSR. These cytokines and chemokines may be adequate biomarkers to monitor responsivity to MBSR.

Method(s): 60 COPD patients (FEV1: 47+/-15%; 42%women) referred to 3-week in-patient PR and classified as "CN" or "CI" according to the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) cutoff-score (<=25points). Domain-specific cognitive function (MoCA, SMMSE, ACER, TICS), health status (CAT), health-related quality of life (SF-36), the 6MWT and cerebral oxygen availability during cycle endurance test (CET) at 75%WR, were assessed on admission and discharge. Result(s): 25 patients (42%) presented evidences of CI and low performance in cognitive tests. Compared to CN, CI patients improved visuospatial skills and fluency (effect size; ES: 0.44; 0.48), whilst similar improvements in memory (ES: 0.75), physical and social function (ES: 0.45; 0.47), vitality (ES: 0.56), general and mental health (ES: 0.47; 0.67) were observed, respectively. CI patients did not improve body pain and limitations from emotional problems as assessed by SF-36 but increased 6MWD (from 378 to 403m, p=0.052), CET (from 10.0 to 12.3min, p<0.001) and SpO2 nadir (DELTA]: +1.1%, p=0.047) in cycling, whilst CET cerebral oxygen availability remained unchanged. The proportion of CI and CN with clinically relevant improvements in 6MWT, CET and CAT was similar. Conclusion(s): CI patients gain significant benefits in cognitive function from PR but are not responsive to improvements in body pain and emotional limitations compared to CN. Persistent body pain may have limited the effectiveness of PR and improvements in the 6MWT in CI patients with COPD.

High prevalence of cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in several studies using brief screening instruments or neuropsychological test batteries. However, the relevance of cognitive impairment as well as the accuracy of screening procedures have never been studied in this patient population. Methods: 151 chronic hemodialysis patients (mean age 65.78 ± 14.88 years, 73,5% male) underwent cognitive testing under standardized conditions by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and, in a second step, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR), an international standard to measure the severity of dementia. For calculating MoCA cut-off values on the basis of the CDR global score, receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis and c-statistic were applied. Results: 49.0% of patients were categorized as 0.5 in the CDR global with memory being the predominantly affected domain (47.7% of patients scored 0.5). Youden's Index led to a threshold of 23.5 points for the MoCA test for optimal differentiation between cognitively normal (CDR global < 0.5) and impaired patients (CDR global 0.5) based on a sensitivity of approximately 99% and a specificity of approximately 74%. Conclusion: Interference of cognitive impairment with patients' independence and daily life was shown using the CDR for the first time in hemodialysis patients. A MoCA score of 23.5 points turned out as optimal threshold to differentiate between patients with and without functional impairment in the CDR, thereby paving the way for implementation of the MoCA test as a quick and thus highly feasible screening instrument for periodic testing in clinical routine.

However cases of spontaneous non-traumatic pneumocephalus remain rare. While the relationship between continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and atraumatic pneumocephalus has been previously reported, to our knowledge the rare presentation associated with sinus wall osteomyelitis has never been described. We summarize here the case of a 67-year-old woman's acute presentation of Streptococcus salvarius infection after a sudden drop in her consciousness. Case presentation: The patient was brought to hospital by family reporting a one week history of sudden deterioration, cognitive decline, and lethargy. The patient presented with reduced arousal, cognitive function (Glasgow Coma Scale: 10, Abbreviated Mental Test Score:CS, 0 AMTS), and no history of trauma. Computed Tomography (CT) imaging was ordered and identified a significant pneumocephalus with no cranial defect. Further investigations acknowledged possible sinus or middle ear disease, which was highlighted by the discovery of S. salivarius by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and potentially exacerbated by the use of nocturnal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The patient made a complete recovery by eliminating likely causative factors and long term regimental antibiotics administration. Conclusion(s): This case highlights a rare neurological presentation of S. salivarius infection with a mixed aetiology of spontaneous pneumocephalus. This case features an atypical complication associated with CPAP use, and to our knowledge is the first case to be associated with sinus wall osteomyelitis. Recognition of the clinical features and risk factors for spontaneous pneumocephalus -while rare-serve to broaden our clinical index of suspicion when presented with patients experiencing neurological deficit. Information from this case may also aid in improving prevention, early diagnosis, and future management.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

In the original article, the spacing of the Appendix was incorrect. The correct Appendix appears in this erratum.] The objective of the study was to develop and validate a translated and culturally adapted Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for the Persian-speaking population. The MMSE was translated into Persian. Two groups of neurologically intact subjects (n = 100) and subjects with Alzheimer's disease (n = 13) were studied. The difference between groups on the mean total scores of the Persian MMSE was statistically significant (control = 28.62 ± 2.09; subjects with Alzheimer's disease = 11.77 ± 5.66; p < .001). The cutoff score of 23 was the best cutoff score for our subjects with a sensitivity and specificity of 98% and 100%, respectively. There was a significant correlation between the Persian MMSE score and the level of education (r = .46) and with age (r = -.77). There was no significant correlation between the Persian MMSE and gender. The Persian MMSE was found to be valid for discrimination of cognitive impairment in the Persian-speaking community.

The purpose of this study was to search for the components of self-rated health among the elderly, drawing on the framework recently proposed by Jylhä (2009) and the degree to which these predict survival. 535 seniors were interviewed, of whom 121 passed away during the seven years that followed. Self-rated health was significantly related to a variety of health and social indicators, which appeared to be represented by five health and three social characteristics: chronic conditions, physical functioning, the ability to perform daily activity, mental health, body pain, economic state, expected future health, and peers’ health. Contrary to Jylhä’s (2009) suggestion, formal signs of illness and diagnosed life threatening conditions were not related to self-rated health. Self-rated health was related to mortality along with age, sex, physical and cognitive functioning, and systolic blood pressure. Only physical functioning predicted both mortality and self-rated health. It appears that self-rated health is comprised of health information that is not directly related to mortality.

DESIGN: Secondary data analysis, cross-sectional. SETTING: University of Florida. SUBJECTS: Individuals over 60years old enrolled in the Neuromodulatory Examination of Pain and mobility Across the Lifespan (NEPAL) study were included if they completed the MoCA and other study measures (n=62). Most participants reported pain on most days during the past three months (63%). METHOD(S): Subjects underwent a health assessment (HAS) and a quantitative sensory testing (QST) session. Health/medical history, cognitive function and self-reported pain measures were administered during the HAS. Mechanical and thermal detection, and thermal pain thresholds were assessed during the QST session. RESULT(S): Older adults with chronic pain had lower MoCA scores compared with controls on domains of executive function, attention, memory, and language (P<0.05). The attention and language domains survived adjustments for age, sex, education, depression, and pain duration (P<0.05). Attention was significantly associated with all pain characteristics including pain intensity and disability, while executive function was associated with mechanical detection (P<0.05). CONCLUSION(S): Our results support previous findings that individuals with chronic pain tend to show poorer cognitive functioning compared with pain-free controls in domains of attention and executive function. Our findings also extend these findings to community-dwelling older adults, who are already most vulnerable to age-related cognitive declines.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Methods: Community‐dwelling outpatients were enrolled if they had no history of neurologic or psychiatric diseases and were not taking any drugs with effects on the central nervous system. Dementia has been excluded with the Functional Activities Questionnaire. The final sample consisted of 597 cognitively healthy Brazilians aged 50 to 90 years. To account for nonlinear relationships, we have used fractional polynomials that provide a flexible parameterization for continuous variables. Results: According to the original proposed cutoff (≤ 25 points), 87% of our sample would be considered impaired. Even using a more conservative suggestion (≤ 22 points), 67% of our normative sample would be regarded as impaired. These data reinforce the need of adjusting cutoffs for schooling in populations with heterogeneous educational backgrounds. MoCA scores presented a nonlinear positive association with education tending to a plateau at higher levels (P < 0.001). On the other hand, MoCA‐MIS scores presented a nonlinear negative relationship with age, with an accelerated pattern at higher age levels (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We presented normative data for the MoCA and the MoCA‐MIS that will facilitate the use of the test in Brazil and, potentially, in other populations with substantial proportions of low‐educated individuals. Moreover, we described a systematic approach for adjusting the effects of age and education using fractional polynomials and provided suggestions on how to account for the nonlinear relationship that is frequently encountered between demographic factors and measures of cognitive performance.

We investigated the structural neuroimaging correlates of MMSE performance in patients with clinical and preclinical AD. We analyzed structural magnetic resonance imaging data from 29 probable AD and 5 MCI patients who later converted to probable AD using an advanced 3D cortical mapping technique. MMSE scores were entered as covariates in a general linear model that predicted the gray matter density at each cortical surface point. The results were corrected for multiple comparisons by permutation testing. The global permutation-corrected significance for the maps linking gray matter loss and cognitive decline was P = 0.005 for the left and P = 0.012 for the right hemisphere. Strongest correlations between MMSE score and gray matter integrity were seen in the entorhinal, parahippocampal, precuneus, superior parietal, and subgenual cingulate/orbitofrontal cortices. Significant correlations were also seen bilaterally in the temporal, the middle frontal and the left angular and supramarginal gyri. As a global cognitive measure, MMSE depends on the integrity of widely distributed cortical areas in both brain hemispheres with left-sided predominance.

Changes in Mini Mental State Examination score after stroke: Lacunar infarction predicts cognitive decline	European Journal of Neurology	Eur.J.Neurol.	2006	05	 	13	5	491	495	Mini Mental State Examination;stroke survivors;lacunar infarction;risk factors;cognitive impairment;Analysis of Variance;Brain;Cerebral Infarction;Cognition Disorders;Female;Functional Laterality;Humans;Hypertension;Male;Neuropsychological Tests;Stroke;Survival Analysis;Cerebrovascular Accidents;Survivors	Stroke and cognitive impairment are inter-related. The purpose of this study was to show the natural evolution of cognitive performance during the first year after a stroke, and to show which factors that predict cognitive decline. Subjects were patients with a first-ever stroke who were treated in a stroke unit. A total of 160 patients were included. At baseline patients were evaluated with regard to stroke type, stroke severity, pre-stroke dementia and other risk factors. Mini Mental State Examinations (MMSE) were performed after 1 week and after 1 year. Patients had a median increase of 1 point (range -8 to +9) on the MMSE. Thirty-two pre cent of the patients deteriorated, 13% were unchanged, and 55% improved. Lacunar infarction (LI) and left-sided stroke were associated with a failure to exhibit improvement. Patients with LI had an average decline of 1.7 points, whilst patients with other stroke types had an average increase of 1.8 points. Most stroke survivors improve cognitively during the first year after the event. The outcome for LI patients is worse, which suggests that LI may serve as a marker for concomitant processes that cause cognitive decline.

The purpose of this study was to describe the properties of MMSE in relation to different stroke characteristics. Materials and Methods: Subjects were survivors (n = 253) of a population-based cohort who had had a first-ever stroke 1 year earlier. At baseline, patients were evaluated with regard to stroke type, stroke severity, unilateral neglect, and prestroke dementia. The 1-year follow-up included an MMSE, a functional evaluation according to the modified Rankin Scale (MRS) and a question regarding subjective memory problems. Results: The mean MMSE was 24.9. Patients with lacunar infarction scored 26.6. Impact of hemisphere localization was insignificant. Twenty-nine percent of the patients had cognitive impairment (cut-off <24). After adjustment for age and education, 16% had cognitive impairment; 41% of the patients had subjective memory problems. The kappa-value between subjective memory problems and dichotomized MMSE was 0.21. Patients with cognitive impairment scored at average 1.8 higher on the MRS. Conclusions: If cut-off is used, the MMSE should be adjusted for age and education; otherwise the prevalence of cognitive impairment may be overestimated. Cognitive impairment heavily influences functional outcome. Subjective memory problems correlate poorly with MMSE. The impact of hemisphere location may previously have been overestimated.

Cognitive impairment in rheumatoid arthritis	Methods and findings in experimental and clinical pharmacology	Methods Find.Exp.Clin.Pharmacol.	2004	06	 	26	5	339	343	Arthritis, Rheumatoid/*complications;Cognition Disorders/*etiology;Adult;Cross-Sectional Studies;Female;Humans;Male;Middle Aged;Psychiatric Status Rating Scales	The objective of this study was to determine the frequency of cognitive impairment in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A cross-sectional study of 40 patients with RA and 40 healthy controls was performed. To assess cognitive impairment, anxiety and depression, the following standardized psychiatric and clinical research methods were used: the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), logic memory tests, short and long memory tests, verbal fluency tests, attention tests, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD)/CAGE scale and the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Patients and controls with incomplete primary education were excluded from the study. Statistics were performed by chi-square test and by Fisher's exact test. Cognitive impairment was observed in 30% of patients with RA and in 7.5% (p < 0.05) of healthy controls. Patients with RA had a significantly worse outcome in verbal fluency (p < 0.05), logic memory (p < 0.05) and short memory (p < 0.05). No statistical difference was observed among the results obtained in the MMSE, BPRS, HAD/CAGE and BDI. There was no significant relation to the duration of the illness, use of corticotherapy or disability. We observed a high prevalence of cognitive impairment in RA patients. Cognitive impairment was not related to clinical and treatment features or disability. More studies are necessary to determine clinical impact of cognitive impairment in RA.

A domestic survey interviewed 343 individuals with 60 years or more, selected by a simple random sample. To identify the violence it was used the Conflict Tactics Scales. Information about identification, demographics and socio-economics characteristics were obtained using the National Health Interview Survey. The Mini-Mental State Examination was used to evaluate mental health. In order to evaluate the functional capacity, the Health Assessment Questionnaire was used. In cases of alcohol suspicion among men, it was used the instrument CAGE. To female elder or caregivers, the TWEAK instrument was used. 43% reported at least one episode of psychological violence. Physical violence was reported by 9.6% of the interviewed, 6.1% reported serious physical violence in this period. The prevalence of different modalities of violence was higher among the youngest individuals, with higher scholarity, among those who have one of the pathologies that characterize the elderly as having a vulnerability (depression and/or urinary incontinence/fecal and/or diabetes and/or rheumatism) and those living with the greatest number of individuals.

Method(s): This is a retrospective study including symptomatic SSV patients treated with MOCA using the ClariVein catheter (Merit Medical, South Jordan, Utah, USA) or OS from 2015 to 2019. Result(s): A total of 60 limbs (73.3% women, mean age 54.7 +/- 14.4 years) were treated with MOCA and 58 limbs (63.8% women, mean age 54 +/- 11.6 years) with OS. At 18 months follow-up, recurrence rates were 7.5% (4/53) for MOCA vs. 5.7% (3/52) for the OS group. MOCA group was associated with less pain at first postoperative day, and an early return to work (MOCA 3.5 +/- 2.3 days vs. OS 14.2 +/- 3.8 days, p <.0001). No cases of leg paresthesia/dysesthesia were observed in the MOCA group, while two patients (3.4%) presented neurological symptoms after OS treatment. Conclusion(s): MOCA and OS are both safe and effective techniques for symptomatic SSV insufficiency. MOCA group demonstrated to be associated with less postoperative pain and early return to work compared to OS.Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

Method: The sample consisted of 3,977 healthy adults who were recruited from Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Cuba, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and, Puerto Rico. Each subject was administered the HVLT-R as part of a larger neuropsychological battery. A standardized five-step statistical procedure was used to generate the norms. Results: The final multiple linear regression models explained 17–45% of the variance in HVLT-R scores. Although t-tests showed significant differences between men and women in Guatemala on the HVLT-R, it was a small effect size. As a result, gender-adjusted norms were not generated. Conclusions: The results from this study will have a substantial impact on the practice of neuropsychology in Latin America, as this is the first normative multicenter study to develop norms for the HVLT-R in this region.

Methods: Using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15), 4065 older Chileans were screened for depression. Social and health variables were included. Self-reported depression diagnosis and antidepressant use were analyzed according to screen-positive depression (GDS-15 ≥ 5). Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors related to screen-positive depression, and self-reported diagnosis and current antidepressant use. Results: Overall, mean age was 71.0 years, 60.9% women, and 71.4% had ≤ 8 years of education. 28.3% of the population screened positive for depression (mild: 21.7%; moderate-severe: 6.5%). Only 35.9% of screen-positive depression individuals self-reported a depression diagnosis (mild: 32.6%; moderate-severe: 47.0%), with significant differences between the sexes (women: 42.2%; men: 22.5%; P < .01). No education (OR = 2.00, 95% CI = 1.20-3.32), multimorbidity (OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 1.42-2.48), dependence (OR = 4.14, 95% CI = 3.11-5.51) and pain (OR = 2.49, 95% CI = 2.01-3.07) were related to screen-positive depression. In people screen-positive depression, men (OR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.35-0.65) and 80 years or older were less likely to self-report depression diagnosis (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.23-0.54), and current antidepressant use (OR = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.14-0.70). Conclusions: A high prevalence of depressive symptoms and low agreement with self-reported depression is observed. There is a need to increase the diagnosis of depression especially in men and people 80 years or older.

Screening for cognitive decline following single known stroke using the Mini-Mental State Examination	Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment	Neuropsychiatr Dis Treat	2011	04/13	 	7	1	 	 	screening tools;cognitive decline;stroke;Mini-Mental State Examination;psychometrics;test validity;test reliability;Mini Mental State Examination;Screening Tests;Cerebrovascular Accidents;Cognitive Impairment	Background: Progressive cognitive decline develops in a nontrivial minority of stroke survivors. Although commonly used to identify cognitive decline in older stroke survivors, the usefulness of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) as a screening tool for post-stroke cognitive decline across a wider range of ages is not well established. This study therefore investigated the usefulness of the MMSE for this purpose. Methods: Twenty-seven subjects, aged 18–82 years, with a single known remote stroke were assessed using the MMSE. The frequency of cognitive impairment was determined by comparison of MMSE scores with population-based norms. Relationships between cognitive performance, motor impairments, age, gender, handedness, stroke laterality, and time since stroke also were explored. Results: Age-adjusted MMSE scores identified mild cognitive impairment in 22.2% and moderate-to-severe cognitive impairment in 7.4% of subjects. Raw and age-adjusted MMSE scores were inversely correlated with time since stroke, but not with other patient or stroke characteristics. Conclusion: A relationship between time since single known stroke and MMSE performance was observed in this study. The proportion of subjects identified as cognitively impaired in this group by Z-transformation of MMSE scores using previously published normative data for this measure comports well with the rates of late post-stroke cognitive impairment reported by other investigators. These findings suggest that the MMSE, when normatively interpreted, may identify cognitive decline in the late period following single known stroke. Additionally, the lack of a relationship between MMSE and Fugl-Meyer scores suggests that the severity of post-stroke motor impairments is unlikely to serve as a clinically useful indicator of the need for cognitive assessment. A larger study of stroke survivors is needed to inform more fully on the usefulness of normatively interpreted MMSE scores as a method of screening for post-stroke cognitive decline.

Cerebral vasculitis in a patient with HCV-related type II mixed cryoglobulinemia	Journal of investigational allergology & clinical immunology	J.Investig.Allergol.Clin.Immunol.	2003	 	 	13	2	135	136	Cryoglobulinemia/*complications;Hepatitis C/*complications;Vasculitis, Central Nervous System/*etiology;Female;Humans;Middle Aged	The peripheral nervous system is often involved in patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (MC), while there are few reports of central nervous system involvement. We describe a case of HCV-related type II MC with peripheral and central nervous system involvement. A 61-year-old woman, suffering from flaccid tetraparesis, was referred to our department because of an increasing disability. The presence of delirium prompted us to also investigate the central nervous system. MMSE, EEG, EMG, brain CT-scan, color-Doppler of neck vessels, retinal fluorangiography and brain MRI were performed. These investigations suggested a cerebral vasculitis. The finding of very low C4 serum levels, together with high rheumatoid factor serum levels, suggested the search for cryoglobulins. The laboratory findings showed a HCV-related type II (IgMk) MC. A marked improvement of symptoms and of laboratory data was obtained by treatment with methylprednisolone + cyclophosphamide.	ID: 12968400; Accession Number: 12968400. Language: English.

Poor health literacy is associated with inadequate bowel prep3. Less is known about how pre-procedural cognition and learning/memory abilities relate to bowel prep in older adults. This study explored the effect of 1) general cognitive status and bowel prep; and 2) neurocognitive diagnoses and bowel prep. METHOD(S): This was a quality assessment project registered with the UF Health Quality Improvement Project (QIPR) and approved for abstract submission. It examined data from August 07, 2017 to December 20, 2017 acquired via the UF Health Preoperative Anesthesia Center. Adults > 65 years who score atypically on a cognitive vital-sign screener are referred for an on-site neurobehavioral exam that includes a clinical interview by a doctoral-level clinician and a psychometristadministered protocol. Tests include a traditional Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) 4 supplemented with more sensitive cognitive measures (e.g.; attention/working memory, language, memory, etc.). From the interview and exam, a licensed neuropsychologist and a postdoctoral fellow completes diagnostic considerations prior to a patient's procedure. Patients who completed a neurobehavioral exam and a colonoscopy with bowel prep assessed with a Boston Bowel Prep Score (BBPS), completed under the supervision of a faculty gastroenterologist, were included in the analysis. To assess the two QIPR aims: General cognitive status was classified as impaired with a MMSE  2 in any of the 3 segments indicates 'adequate' and BBPS score of  2 in any of the 3 segments indicates 'adequate' and BBPS score of 24 n= 28; X2 (1, = 38) = 1.78, p<.18). Patients with MND (n= 7) and psychiatric disorders (n=10) were more likely to have inadequate bowel prep than patients with MldND (n=10) and pain-related conditions (n=11; X2 (4, = 38) = 12.36, p<.05). CONCLUSION(S): Patients showing signs of major neurocognitive disorder or psychiatric distress appear at risk for inadequate colonoscopy prep. This QIPR suggests that targeted interventions for these diagnostic subgroups may improve bowel prep. Future clinical trials conducted in the perioperative surgical home to optimize surgical outcomes and improved health care delivery are a priority.

Method: One hundred and sixty-five community dwelling elderly 65-year-old and over (mean age of 78 years), following recent operated traumatic hip fracture without clinical evidence for another acute medical or surgical condition were assessed regarding age, sex, chronic medical conditions, pre-fracture functional status, type of fracture and of operation, pain perception, and cognitive status. Pain was measured using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS). Functional status was measured using the Functional Independence Measurement (FIM). Activities of Daily Living (ADL) were assessed using the Katz index. Results: The average VAS score on admission was 7.38 ± 1.20 and on discharge 3.67 ± 1.18. Pain on admission inversely correlated to family support, function prior to fracture and cognitive status on admission, and correlated positively with depressed mood. With every increase of one point in VAS on admission above 4 points, the FIM on discharge decreased by 8.77 and the length of stay increased by 4.76 days. Conclusions: Pain intensity may add a valuable dimension for the prognostic evaluation of the patients with hip fractures. Inadequate early patient assessment and associated treatment impact on the patients' functional outcome, prolonged duration of rehabilitation treatment, and therefore, in addition to socio-economic effect, increase the cost to the local health care setting.

Demographic variables and test scores of 'hippo' versus 'rhinoceros' responders were compared with Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables. Twenty-nine of 119 subjects responded incorrectly to the rhinoceros item. Twenty-seven subjects responded 'hippo' or 'hippopotamus.' Of the 117 subjects included, more women made this error and there were no other demographic differences. A 'hippo' response was associated with increased odds of PD-mild cognitive impairment. However, on neuropsychological testing, hippo responders scored significantly worse on Executive-Cognitive Flexibility and Learning/Memory variables. This 25% error rate on the MoCA rhinoceros item is in contrast to a study of 135 subjects, 38 whom were cognitively impaired, where MoCA naming was a poor discriminator of cognitive impairment because it was felt to be too easy. The results suggest that the cognitive profile of non-demented PD hippo responders includes deficits in attention and visuospatial and executive functions.

Tests of neurocognitive function (NCF) and symptoms (using the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory-Brain Tumor module; MDASI-BT) and of quality of life (European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire EORTC QLQ]-C30/BN20) examined the net clinical benefit (NCB) of therapy. Patients and Methods: NCF tests (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, Trail Making Test, and Controlled Oral Word Association), MDASI-BT, and EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20 were completed in a subset of patients. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression modeling determined the prognostic value of baseline and early change from baseline to cycle 1 for OS and PFS. Two-sample proportional test statistic was used to evaluate differences between treatments (dose-dense v standard-dose) on NCB measures from baseline to cycle 4 in stable patients. Result(s): Overall, 182 patients participated in the study. Baseline NCF tests and the physical functioning quality of life scale were associated with OS and PFS. Baseline to cycle 1 in all NCB components were associated with OS and PFS. There was greater deterioration in the dose-dense arm from baseline to cycle 4 in the Global Health and Motor Function subscales (EORTC QLQ-C30/BN20) as well as in overall symptom burden, overall symptom interference, and activity-related symptom interference subscales (MDASI-BT). There were no between-arm differences in NCF. Conclusion(s): Longitudinal collection of NCB measures is feasible in cooperative group studies and provides an added dimension to standard outcome measures. Greater adverse symptom burden and functional interference, as well as decreased global health and motor function were observed in patients randomly assigned to the dose-dense arm. Baseline and early change in NCB measures were associated with decreased rates of survival.Copyright © 2013 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.

Some aspects concerning psychiatric comorbidity in dementia still remain unstudied 2]. The aim of our study was to examine some prominent neuropsychiatric and behavioural disturbances in elderly patients with vascular cognitive disorder (VCD) and to provide helpful key points. Method(s): Eighty four consecutive patients aged over 60, diagnosed with VCD, admitted to acute gerontopsychiatric ward, underwent clinical psychiatric assessment and evaluation on MMSE, HAM-D-17, HAM-A, NPI, Cohen-Mansfield Inventory. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were applied. Summary of results: A variety of neuropsychiatric symptoms were present along with that of cognitive decline. Usually multiple symptoms occurred simultaneously, which we summarized and profoundly examined on a syndrome level as follows: Psychosis, in terms mostly of visual and verbal hallucinations and less paranoid delusions; Major Depression; Apathy, Anxiety. Depression and anxiety were more frequent in mild cognitive impairment (r = -0.486, p<0.001; r = -0.536, p<0.001); apathy - in severe (r = 0.580; p<0.001). In relation of severity of depression, significantly prevalent was moderate depression 77.7% (p <0.001). We would like to point out some diagnostic difficulties concerning differentiation between some psychiatric symptoms and syndromes. The areas of overlap between apathy and major depression are diminished interest, psychomotor retardation and insight. Key points for depression are dynamic in mood, especially dysphoria, and vegetative symptoms of depression. The relationship between anxiety and depression is in terms of comorbidity or anxious depression. Key points for a state of anxiety could be restlessness, pacing, muscle tension, pressure on chest, sighing, feeling of breathlessness, fearful anticipation. Key points distinguishing dementia from depression are the lack of insight, lack of feelings of worthlessness, guilt, etc. Important considerations in patients with VCD are some behavioural disturbances, which we summarized according to Cohen-Mansfield in 4 types 3]: Verbally aggressive behaviours; Physically aggressive behaviours; Physically non-aggressive behaviours; Verbally non-aggressive behaviours. Aggressive behaviours were associated with moderate cognitive impairment (p<0.05) and psychosis; verbally non-aggressive behaviours - with depression, mild cognitive impairment and somatic comorbidity. Physically non-aggressive behaviours were prevalent in moderate dementia. Differential dilemmas are delirium, somatic comorbidity, medications (overdose, side effects), severe uncontrolled pain, etc. We registered higher rates of distress with aggressive behaviours and with some forms of verbal non-aggressive behaviours as constant request on attention, complaining or negativism in relation to frequency. Undoubtedly, major depression may complicate and accelerate VCD. Challenging behaviours increase the risk of harm to self or others. Medical staff should identify, assess and monitor factors such as these. Despite some doubts, whether the cognitive impairment is temporally related to depression, or depression is an associated feature, we strongly recommend antidepressant treatment 4]. Managing aggression or agitation in respect to risk/benefit should be applied 5]. Conclusion(s): The therapeutic decision-making should be based on comprehensive medical evidence. The practical usefulness of precisely differentiated psychiatric disturbances in VCD is connected with selection of a proper therapeutic approach and prediction of outcome or disability.

Understanding determinants of qual-ity of life (QOL) for AL residents near EOL is vital to providing care for this growing population, a majority of whom have some level of cognitive impairment (CI). Previous studies suggest the self-reported QOL of people with CI is not determined by their degree of CI, and is underestimated by their caregivers. This analysis aimed to identify factors that shape QOL in a diverse sample of AL residents with CI approaching EOL. Method(s): Data in this analysis are from a 5-year NIA-funded prospective, mixed-methods study (R01AG047048) examining EOL care in 7 diverse AL communities in the Atlanta area. Residents were enrolled if they were: at least 85 years old, diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions or a life-limiting illness, and/or enrolled in hospice. QOL was assessed with the self-reported QOL-AD survey, modified for AL. Cognition was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), with CI defined as MoCA score <= 26 out of 30. Functional limitation was determined using 13 items from the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) Multidimensional Assessment Questionnaire. Psychological distress was assessed with the PHQ-4, and pain with the Iowa Pain Thermometer. We calculated Pearson's r correlation coefficients for bivariate analysis of factors related to QOL. We hypothesized that QOL would not be correlated with MoCA score; but among residents with CI, QOL would be negatively correlated with psychological distress, functional limitation, and pain. Result(s): The sample (n=69) was 64% female, 57% white, 41% black, and age ranged from 58 to 103 (median 86). The mean MoCA score was 16 (SD=6.7) and 66 residents scored <= 26, indicating CI. There was no significant correlation between MoCA score and QOL (r=.024, p=.8). Among residents with CI, QOL was negatively correlated with psychological distress (r=-.43, p<.001) and functional limitation (r=-.24, p=.048) at significant levels, and with pain at a non-significant level (r=-.21, p=.09). Conclusion(s): The lack of correlation between MoCA score and self-reported QOL suggests that AL residents have potential to expe-rience high QOL despite CI. Psychological distress and functional limitation are modifiable factors correlated with QOL in AL residents with CI, which could be targeted to improve EOL care.

Method(s): CI was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (scores <= 26) and QoL was determined with the self-reported QoL in Alzheimer's disease survey adapted for use in AL. Psychological distress was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-4 and fatigue was assessed using the 13-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale. Initial descriptive analyses were followed by backward stepwise regression analyses to select a best-fitting model of QoL. Result(s): The final model predicted 27% of the variance in QoL. CI was not significantly correlated with QoL and was not retained in the final model. Pain and functional limitation also did not meet inclusion criteria (P <= .10) and were sequentially removed, producing a final model of QoL in terms of psychological distress (beta = -0.28, P = .032), fatigue (beta = -0.26, P = .048), and race (beta = 0.21, P = .063). Conclusions and Implications: The lack of a significant correlation between degree of CI and self-reported QoL suggests that AL residents have the potential to experience high QoL, despite CI. Interventions to reduce psychological distress and manage fatigue could be implemented during EOL care to attempt to improve QoL for AL residents with CI. The correlation between race and QoL warrants investigation into possible racial disparities in AL and EOL care.Copyright © 2019 AMDA - The Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine	ID: 2003957034; M1: (Arneson, Bender, Robert, Perkins) Division of General Medicine & Geriatrics, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States; M1: (Perkins) Birmingham/Atlanta VA Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC), Atlanta, GA, United States	 		 	 	Elsevier Inc.

Methods: Comparability study on a subset of 405 participants, aged ≥70 years, from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), a longitudinal study in 4 United States communities. The 3MSE, the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS) and the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) were administered within 30 days of one another. Regression models were developed to predict the 3MSE score from the TICS and/or IQCODE, and the predicted values were used to estimate missing 3MSE scores in longitudinal follow-up of 4,274 CHS participants. Results: The TICS explained 67% of the variability in 3MSE scores, with a correlation of 0.82 between predicted and observed scores. The IQCODE alone was not a good estimate of 3MSE score, but improved the model fit when added to the TICS model. Using estimated 3MSE scores classified more participants with low cognition, and rates of decline were greater than when only the observed 3MSE scores were considered. Conclusions: 3MSE scores can be reliably estimated from the TICS, with or without the IQCODE. Incorporating these estimates captured more cognitive decline in older adults.

Although several drugs are indicated for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD), no published study has separately analysed mild and moderate AD subgroups to assess the effect of dosage. Objective(s): To compare the efficacy and safety of galantamine 16 and 24mg/day in patient subgroups with mild or moderate AD. Method(s): This post hoc analysis (n = 838) of a 5-month, randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of galantamine 16 and 24 mg/day in a subgroup of patients with mild AD (Mini-Mental State Examination MMSE] >18) and a subgroup with moderateAD (MMSE 10-18). Efficacy outcomes included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) score and treatment response (ADAScog maintenance >=0-point improvement], improvement >=4 points and improvement >=7 points). Result(s): Mean ADAS-cog scores of patients with mild AD demonstrated significant improvement from baseline with galantamine 16 and 24mg/day (p lt; 0.001 for both), whereas cognitive function did not change significantly for placebo recipients (p = 0.559). Patients with moderate AD improved with galantamine 24mg/day (p = 0.009) but not with 16 mg/day (p = 0.768); a decline occurred with placebo (p < 0.001). A greater proportion of patients treated with galantamine 16mg/day (76% and 52% for mild and moderate AD, respectively) or 24 mg/day (69% and 61%, respectively) demonstrated a treatment response (i.e. ADAS-cog was maintained or improved) relative to placebo (55% and 28%, respectively; p < 0.05). Patients with moderate AD trended toward greater response with the 24 mg/day dosage than with the 16mg/day dosage. Galantamine was well tolerated. Adverse events were comparable for all study groups with mild or moderate AD. Conclusion(s): This post hoc analysis suggests that galantamine 16 mg/day is the optimal dosage for patients with mild AD, as similar efficacy is observed with the 24mg/day dose. However, patients with moderate AD appear to gain additional benefit from galantamine 24 mg/day. © 2009 Adis Data Information BV. All rights reserved.

Patients were divided into 2 groups by gender: 21 patients composed the main group, 77 male patients composed the control group. All patients were examined for metabolic status and hemodynamic characteristics. Before surgery, duplex scanning of extracranial arteries, CT angiography of extracranial and intracranial arteries was performed; the intima-media complex, the characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque, the linear velocity of blood flow, the straightness of the arteries course were evaluated. The cognitive status of the patient was determined using the MoCA scale. The results of carotid stenosis elimination in early (30 days) and late (up to 3 years) periods are analyzed. Statistical processing was performed using "STATISTICA-10" software package. The value "p < 0.05" is indicated as statistically significant. Result(s): Atherosclerotic carotid stenosis in women debuted at a later age (p < 0.05). The course of the atherosclerotic process in women was characterized by more pronounced metabolic changes and hemodynamic perioperative instability. In particular, diabetes mellitus was more common in female patients (p < 0.05). The level of total cholesterol and the coefficient of atherogenicity was higher in women (6,410 +/- 0,527 v / s 6,044 +/- 0,769 and 4,250 +/- 1,133 v / s 3,454 +/- 1,039; p < 0,05). Systolic blood pressure before surgery was higher in women (146,286 +/- 19,436 mmHg v / s 131,522 +/- 19,390 mmHg, p = 0,031). Intraoperative systolic blood pressure fluctuations - 54,375 +/- 9,797 mmHg in women and 42,632 +/- 19,676 mmHg in men (p < 0,05). The clamping time of carotid arteries was not statistically different and was 18,800 +/- 7,544 in female patients and 17,694 +/- 7,255 in male patients (p < 0,559). The early postoperative period was characterized by unstable hemodynamics in the first day in female patients: maximum systolic blood pressure was 185,273 +/- 21,081 mmHg in women and 159,048 +/- 23,470 mmHg in men (p = 0,004); more pronounced fluctuations in systolic blood pressure were more typical for women (82,500 +/- 33,875 mmHg v / s 44,964 +/- 16,281 mmHg; p = 0,0001). In female patients, complications were more common in the first day after surgery: women more often reported such complaints as headaches and dizziness (38% v / s 6.5% and 33.3% v / s 1.3%, p = 0.001), Atrial fibrillation was noted in 2 (9.5%) patients (p < 0.05). Transient ischemic attacks were noted in 1 man (1.3%) and 1 woman (9.5%, p = 0.38) during 1 month after surgery. An acute impairment of cerebral circulation in the early period was noted in 1 female patient (p = 0.2). Conclusion(s): Women have more severe metabolic disorders, which affects the features of the course of atherosclerotic carotid artery lesions and the results of surgical intervention.

In this study, we aimed at analyzing mortality and its predictors in a cohort of 105 PD patients treated with LCIG for over 10 years. Method(s): The death rate, death causes, mortality predictors, and serious adverse events (SAEs) were analyzed. A Cox regression model was used to estimate the influence of several demographic and clinical factors on mortality, and a binary logistic regression to evaluate the association between SAEs number and mortality. Kaplan-Meier and Log-rank test was used for a survival comparison between patients with an early drop-out (within 3 years since LCIG start) and patients continuing LCIG. Result(s): Ninety-eight advanced PD patients treated with LCIG were included. During follow-up, 34.7% of patients died at a mean age of 74.7 years, with a mean survival time of 4.6 years since LCIG start and 18 years since PD onset. The only predictor of mortality identified was the Mini Mental State Examination score at LCIG start (p:0.034). A total of 222 SAEs occurred in 87.9% of LCIG patients. The number of SAEs did not correlate with the mortality of LCIG patients (p:0.370). No survival difference exists between early drop-out patients and those continuing LCIG (p:0.341). Conclusion(s): Our findings do not indicate an association between SAEs or LCIG treatment duration and mortality and highlight the importance of cognitive alterations as a mortality predictor of LCIG patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd	ID: 2003323445; M1: (Artusi, Balestrino, Imbalzano, Bortolani, Montanaro, Tuttobene, Fabbri, Zibetti, Lopiano) Department of Neuroscience "Rita Levi Montalcini", University of Torino, Torino, Italy	 		 	 	Elsevier Ltd	United Kingdom				 	1353-8020; 1873-5126	 	C.A.

We present the results of the activity of an ad hoc ward, called "Unita di Valutazione Alzheimer" (UVA) (Unit of Evaluation for Alzheimer), along the first two years of the "CRONOS" project (CP). We evaluated the efficacy and safety of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChE-I) agents in the treatment of mild to moderate AD and the population served by the UVA. Three hundred fifty-four patients referred to our ward for cognitive deficits. According to the CP criteria, 66 patients (42 women and 24 men, mean age 74.1 +/- 5.8 years) were enrolled in the study. Evaluation was carried out at baseline and after 3, 9, 15, and 21 months. Our results showed a positive impact of these drugs on patients with mild to moderate AD during the first nine months of treatment. After this period, we observed a progressive lowering of the mini mental state examination (MMSE) scores, with a global impairment of 0.9-1.0 points per year. The adverse events were generally not troublesome. Our data strongly support the usefulness of UVA in the AD case ascertainment during the early phase of the disease. Moreover, the CP provided a general better knowledge about this important and devastating disease.

It remains to be determined whether the latent structure of fear of pain is consistent between patients seeking treatment for pain versus those drawn from representative community samples. The purpose of the present investigation was to determine if the latent structure of fear of pain is characterized by latent continuity in a representative community sample of older adults. Using taxometric methods in a sample of 459 community dwelling older adults, we sought to evaluate the latent structure of fear of pain as indexed by the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale. Results from analyses of simulated Monte Carlo data, MAXEIG-HITMAX, and L-mode consistency tests indicated that the latent structure of fear of pain in this sample was the same as that previously reported in clinical samples, being non-taxonic and characterized by latent continuity. These findings confirm initial findings that fear of pain, at least as measured by the Pain Anxiety Symptoms Scale, is continuous, occurring along a latent continuum ranging from low to high. Results are discussed in relation to the conceptual understanding of fear of pain, implications for assessment and treatment, and future research directions.

Design Preliminary, exploratory, cross‐sectional study. Methods Using psychophysics (to measure intensity and unpleasantness) and functional magnetic resonance imaging blood oxygenation level dependent methods (to measure stimulus‐evoked brain activation), we will examine sex‐ and age‐associated differences in thermal pain processing and their underlying neurophysiology in a broad range of healthy adults (ages 30–89). We will acquire resting state functional connectivity data for secondary analyses exploring whether resting state connectivity predicts psychophysical and neurophysiological responses to thermal pain. To examine the effects of altered blood flow, we will acquire resting‐state arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance imaging data to quantify resting cerebral blood flow. We will interpret findings in the context of a proposed neural model of pain, ageing, and sex. Study funding was received in June of 2014. Ethical approval was obtained from the Vanderbilt University IRB prior to study initiation. Conclusion Exploring the biological reasons for age‐ and sex‐associated differences in pain processing will increase our understanding of pain in older adults. The paucity of neurobiological evidence to support best practice pain management in older adults places these individuals at risk for poor pain management. Impact Poorly treated pain in older adults is a critical public health problem associated with a poor quality of life and increased healthcare costs. Understanding how age and sex have an impact on central processing of pain across the lifespan is a critical step toward improving personalized pain medicine.

The majority of factor analytic studies have found a two-factor (i.e., pain intensity and pain interference) structure for this instrument; however, because the BPI was developed with an a priori hypothesis of the relationship among its items, it follows that construct validity investigations should use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Objectives: The purpose of this work was to establish the construct validity of the BPI using a CFA framework and demonstrate factorial invariance using a range of demographic variables. Methods: A retrospective CFA was completed in a sample of individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS and cancer (n = 364; 63% male; age 21–92 years, M = 51.80). A baseline one-factor model was compared against two-factor and three-factor models (i.e., pain intensity, activity interference, and affective interference) that were developed based on the hypothetical design of the instrument. Results: Fit indices for the three-factor model were statistically superior when compared with the one-factor model and marginally better when compared with the two-factor model. This three-factor structure was found to be invariant across disease, age, and ethnicity groups. Conclusion: The results of this study provide evidence to support a three-factor representation of the BPI, and the originally hypothesized two-factor structure. Such findings will begin to provide clinical trialists, pharmaceutical sponsors, and regulators with confidence in the psychometric properties of this instrument when considering its inclusion in clinical research.

The aim of this study is to compare the pain severity, patient and surgeon's satisfaction in the first and the second eye surgeries. Method(s): After approval of the Ethical Committee and the patient informed consent, in a prospective clinical trial, 29 candidates of cataract surgery aged between 40-70 years old, ASA I-II under topical anesthesia with tetracaine and conscious sedation with fentanyl 2 mug/kg and propofol 20mg were studied. The doses of drugs were increased if any of these situations were seen: surgeon's dissatisfaction, patient's eye movement, uncontrolled movement of patient's limbs, pain complains and hemodynamic changes more than 30% (HR and MAP). The pain intensity (VAS), surgeon/patient's satisfaction, patient's cooperation, doses of drugs, side effects, hemodynamic changes, patient cognitive dysfunction (MMSE) were compared between the first and the second eye surgeries using Willcoxon, t-paired, and chi-square tests via SPSS-11.5 software. Result(s): The pain intensity and fentanyl requirement were significantly more and the patient's satisfaction and MMSE scores were significantly less in the second eye surgery. There were no significant differences in surgeon's satisfaction, patient's cooperation, side effects and changes in hemodynamic changes between the first and second eye surgeries. Conclusion(s): The intensity of the pain and the patient's discomfort were more in the surgery of the second eye. Therefore patients need more analgesic and sedation during the cataract surgery of the second eye.
